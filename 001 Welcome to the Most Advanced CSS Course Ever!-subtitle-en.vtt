00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.622
- Hello, and welcome to the most advanced

2
00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:07.566
and modern CSS course in the world.

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.686
I'm really excited to have you in this massive course,

4
00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:12.337
and I promise you made the right choice

5
00:00:12.337 --> 00:00:14.661
by joining me in this adventure.

6
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:16.314
Now, without further ado,

7
00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:17.997
I want to give you a quick overview

8
00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.797
of how the course is organized,

9
00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:22.037
the projects that are included in the course,

10
00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:24.714
and what exactly you are gonna learn.

11
00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:28.249
So, the course contains a total of seven sections

12
00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.230
with over 20 hours of content.

13
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.740
We start with Section Two,

14
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.634
where we're going to jump right into our first project

15
00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:38.285
and start learning some advanced CSS.

16
00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:40.054
So this is the Natours project

17
00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.370
that we're going to start building in Section Two

18
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.798
all the way to the end of Section Six.

19
00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:47.809
It's a huge landing page that I designed specifically

20
00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.366
to teach you a lot of different new CSS

21
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.757
properties and techniques, animations,

22
00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:55.936
advanced responsive designs, CSS architecture,

23
00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:57.375
and much more.

24
00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.503
And you see that there are a lot of effects

25
00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:02.041
going on here on this page.

26
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.038
Now, in Section Three, we take a detailed look

27
00:01:05.038 --> 00:01:07.760
at how CSS actually works behind the scenes.

28
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.347
And we're also going to talk a bit about CSS architecture

29
00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:13.461
so that you can gain the kind of knowledge

30
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:16.866
that many CSS developers out there don't have.

31
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.150
Next up, I will introduce you to Sass

32
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.131
and to the NPM ecosystem,

33
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.652
which will give you a whole new set of tools,

34
00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:26.842
allowing you to write and compile Sass code.

35
00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:30.055
Then, Section Five is the biggest part of the course.

36
00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.971
And this is where we'll continue building

37
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:34.047
the Natours project that I showed you,

38
00:01:34.047 --> 00:01:35.294
and where you will learn

39
00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.564
countless new CSS properties and features.

40
00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.069
After that, in Section Six,

41
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.749
we keep building the Natours project,

42
00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.913
but now with a heavy focus on advanced responsive design.

43
00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:49.868
In Section Seven, we then build a whole new project,

44
00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:52.749
this time using the immense power of Flexbox.

45
00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.783
So, I will introduce you to this amazing new technology

46
00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.449
and then we build this entire

47
00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:00.005
modern-looking project called trillo

48
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.041
using Flexbox and some other stuff

49
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.334
that I'm going to show you as well.

50
00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.605
Finally, the last section is a bit similar

51
00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:08.077
to the Flexbox section,

52
00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:09.573
but this time, you're going to learn the

53
00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:13.235
even more cutting-edge CSS grid technology.

54
00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:15.618
However, this section is not available right now

55
00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:17.055
as a launched course,

56
00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:20.001
but it will be added a bit later in 2017.

57
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:20.834
So don't worry.

58
00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:23.536
By the time you master everything there is in the course,

59
00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:26.665
I will be adding the CSS grid section.

60
00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:30.252
So that is a broad overview of the course structure.

61
00:02:30.252 --> 00:02:31.534
Now, in all the videos,

62
00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:34.917
I always do my best to explain every single details

63
00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:36.589
of the techniques that I'm using

64
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.962
or the technologies that I'm introducing

65
00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:41.494
but sometimes you might still have a question

66
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.997
about any of the topics that you're learning,

67
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.294
and that's fantastic

68
00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:47.895
because asking questions is great.

69
00:02:47.895 --> 00:02:50.883
Or maybe you just run into a problem with your code

70
00:02:50.883 --> 00:02:52.466
and need help fixing it

71
00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:55.297
because it doesn't really work the way it should.

72
00:02:55.297 --> 00:02:58.049
Either way, you will always get support and help

73
00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.329
in the Udemy Q&amp;A section.

74
00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.566
So at the bottom of the video that you're watching,

75
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:06.115
you will find a question section for that specific video.

76
00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:07.625
And whenever you have a question,

77
00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.484
you can check out if other students

78
00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:11.365
may have asked the same question.

79
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:14.375
And if not, you can just post your own question.

80
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.300
And you will then get friendly support

81
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.004
so that you're back to writing code as fast as possible.

82
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:23.116
And now just to finish, I designed this course for you.

83
00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:24.866
To bring your CSS skills

84
00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:27.806
to the most modern and advanced level

85
00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.974
and to give you the tools so that you can build

86
00:03:29.974 --> 00:03:34.141
any webpage or app that you can imagine from the ground up.

87
00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.621
And so we cover everything

88
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.848
that all the other courses don't cover

89
00:03:37.848 --> 00:03:39.819
so that you can become the confident

90
00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.385
front-end web developer that you want to be.

91
00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:44.623
That is my main goal for this course.

92
00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:48.790
And with that being said, let's finally get started with it.
