00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:02.650
<v Jonas>Welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.820
Let's now finally learn something new in CSS.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.991
Which is exactly why you came to this course, right?

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:12.531
Now, as in all my other courses,

5
00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:14.034
in all the coding lectures,

6
00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:15.736
I always have this slide called

7
00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:17.858
What You Will Learn in this Lecture.

8
00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:20.535
And I found that students really appreciate

9
00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.372
this quick lecture summary,

10
00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:25.047
so that they can later come back to the lecture

11
00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:27.845
and know if it contains exactly what they are looking for

12
00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:28.843
or not.

13
00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:31.070
And that's why I decided to continue this tradition

14
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.373
in this course.

15
00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:34.095
In this lecture, you're gonna learn

16
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:36.741
the best way to perform a basic reset

17
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.792
using the universal selector.

18
00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:42.234
And how to set up project-wide font definitions.

19
00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:44.122
This might not be really new to you,

20
00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:46.135
but we still have to do this

21
00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:48.347
whenever we start a new project.

22
00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:51.557
Now, what probably is new to you, is to clip parts

23
00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:54.968
of elements using the new clip-path property.

24
00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:57.775
And so that's the first real new modern CSS

25
00:00:57.775 --> 00:00:58.878
you're gonna learn.

26
00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:00.878
Let's do that right now.

27
00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:04.114
All right, so we're back in the code editor

28
00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:05.370
that I showed you before.

29
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.997
In this screen we have always the code editor

30
00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:10.174
and then I have here another screen on the side

31
00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:12.299
where I keep the webpage open

32
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.900
so we can check on the work that we've been doing.

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.689
Now this here is the final webpage

34
00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.918
that I also will keep open as a reference

35
00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:23.146
so that we can see always what to do next.

36
00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:27.227
And so let's now actually open the website document

37
00:01:27.227 --> 00:01:28.467
that we're gonna work on.

38
00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:32.298
So it's this index.html, of course, in the project folder.

39
00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:33.785
So in my case, it's on the desktop,

40
00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:35.828
but maybe in your case it's somewhere else,

41
00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:39.908
but let's go open this index.html file for now.

42
00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:41.389
And of course it's still empty

43
00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:44.223
because we didn't write any code yet, right?

44
00:01:44.223 --> 00:01:47.089
Now later on we're gonna open this index.html

45
00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:48.274
in a slightly different way.

46
00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.643
We're basically gonna create a small local web server.

47
00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:54.023
But for now this works just fine.

48
00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:57.275
All right, so let's go back now to the editor.

49
00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:01.376
Now to start, let's write the html for the header element.

50
00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:05.043
Just for this part. This green, big element.

51
00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.154
All of this will be our header.

52
00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.929
For now, we're only gonna concentrate on

53
00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.563
the background image and on making this shape here, okay?

54
00:02:15.563 --> 00:02:19.770
That's what we're gonna focus on in this lecture.

55
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.921
We're gonna use the HTML5 header element.

56
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:28.088
And we're also going to give it a class called header.

57
00:02:29.728 --> 00:02:32.245
If you're wondering why we're giving it a class name,

58
00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:34.743
instead of just selecting it in the CSS

59
00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:36.633
using the header element selector,

60
00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.236
it's because you want a class name

61
00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:40.875
on each and every element here in the html.

62
00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:44.252
But we're gonna talk a bit more about CSS architecture

63
00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:47.313
later in the course, where all of this will make sense.

64
00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:49.464
Just for now, let's simply put some text here.

65
00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:50.631
So, some text.

66
00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:53.980
And that's enough for the html for now.

67
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.637
Remember we just want this big box with the background image

68
00:02:57.637 --> 00:03:01.955
and the color and then that shape that we just saw, okay?

69
00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:04.395
Let's now head over to our CSS file

70
00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:07.392
and start writing some CSS.

71
00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:08.830
Now the first thing I'm gonna do

72
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.266
is to perform a basic reset.

73
00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.498
And maybe if you took my other CSS course,

74
00:03:13.498 --> 00:03:15.464
then you might remember that I used something called

75
00:03:15.464 --> 00:03:19.661
Normalize that CSS in order to make a cross browser reset.

76
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.624
So in order to make every browser render the page

77
00:03:22.624 --> 00:03:24.575
in the exact same way.

78
00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:27.627
Now doing so is still valid, but I found that browsers

79
00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:29.300
are actually getting better and better

80
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.670
and more consistent in the way that they render a website.

81
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.827
And so that's no longer really necessary,

82
00:03:34.827 --> 00:03:36.475
and so I don't do it anymore.

83
00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:40.828
Let's just do a simple reset using the universal selector.

84
00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:42.059
Just like this.

85
00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.299
The universal selector will select each and every element

86
00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.758
on the page, and then apply these declarations here to it.

87
00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:53.218
We want a margin on all of them of zero pixels

88
00:03:53.218 --> 00:03:56.495
and of course also a padding of zero.

89
00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:59.326
By default, browsers apply a certain margin,

90
00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:01.519
or a certain padding, to some elements.

91
00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.052
For example, an H1 element, so the main heading,

92
00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:06.872
there's always some margin in it.

93
00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:08.813
And we don't want any of that.

94
00:04:08.813 --> 00:04:11.203
This allows us basically to start clean,

95
00:04:11.203 --> 00:04:14.313
without the browser adding any margins or paddings,

96
00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:16.523
that we don't want, to our elements.

97
00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.270
Another thing that we're gonna do,

98
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.103
is to set a box sizing property to border box.

99
00:04:24.587 --> 00:04:26.327
Border. Box.

100
00:04:26.327 --> 00:04:29.112
And if you're not familiar with box sizing border box,

101
00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:31.900
what this does is to change the box model

102
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.400
so that the borders and the paddings are no longer added

103
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.857
to the total width or the total height

104
00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:39.980
that we specify for a box.

105
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.755
Without this, any paddings and borders

106
00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:45.997
are added to the height or the width of an element

107
00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:47.933
which really isn't helpful for us,

108
00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:51.196
and so with this, we're getting rid of that behavior.

109
00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:55.346
All right. And next, let's set some overall font properties

110
00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:56.695
for the entire webpage.

111
00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.137
This time, we're not going to do it

112
00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:02.502
in the universal selector, but in the body element selector.

113
00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.193
And why do we do it this way?

114
00:05:04.193 --> 00:05:07.097
Well, we do it because the properties related to font

115
00:05:07.097 --> 00:05:08.756
are usually inherited,

116
00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:11.273
so we're using the power of inheritance here.

117
00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:14.005
I'm gonna explain everything there is about inheritance

118
00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:15.373
in the next section.

119
00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:18.788
We have a whole lecture just about inheritance in CSS.

120
00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:20.320
What you need to know for now,

121
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.964
is that we set, for example, the font family

122
00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:26.941
on the body element, which is basically the parent element

123
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:28.807
of all the other elements.

124
00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:31.371
Then this font family will get inherited,

125
00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:34.532
but all the child elements of the body.

126
00:05:34.532 --> 00:05:37.232
And doing it this way is actually more efficient,

127
00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:40.027
and it's a better practice than to just put all of this

128
00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:42.291
in the universal selector up here.

129
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.520
We never do that.

130
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.761
Everything related to font,

131
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.426
we always specify it here in the body selector.

132
00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:49.914
We set the font family to Lato.

133
00:05:49.914 --> 00:05:53.927
And if that's not available, then just some Sans Serif.

134
00:05:53.927 --> 00:05:56.659
I can use Lato because I already included it here

135
00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:57.982
in the html.

136
00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:01.036
As I said in the beginning, this comes from Google fonts,

137
00:06:01.036 --> 00:06:03.136
and it's a font that I have already included.

138
00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:07.285
If you're not familiar with this, it's really simple.

139
00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:09.796
You can just go to Google Fonts and find it out.

140
00:06:09.796 --> 00:06:11.738
I included Lato with the font weights of

141
00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.988
100, 300, 400, 700 and 900.

142
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.843
Let's set the overall font weight to just 400.

143
00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.096
Font weight. 400.

144
00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:25.981
Also the overall font size should be 16 pixels

145
00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:30.335
and the line height of, let's say, 1.7.

146
00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:35.828
So basically line height 1.7 means that

147
00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:39.661
it's 1.7 times bigger than the predefined line height,

148
00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:41.436
that we would have without this.

149
00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:44.035
We're using 16 pixels here for now,

150
00:06:44.035 --> 00:06:45.917
but we're actually going to change this later

151
00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:47.354
to use a better technique,

152
00:06:47.354 --> 00:06:50.588
but for now, let's go with these pixels.

153
00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:54.469
Something else we can set here is the overall text color,

154
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.830
which I'm sure you also know how to do it.

155
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.457
And it's just color.

156
00:06:58.457 --> 00:07:01.077
And then the color that I chose for this text

157
00:07:01.077 --> 00:07:02.577
is this gray, 777.

158
00:07:04.682 --> 00:07:07.623
And here in my text territory actually have

159
00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:10.390
an extension, which then nicely highlights the color.

160
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.334
This is how the color looks like, this gray 777.

161
00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:15.884
It also does it up here in the comments.

162
00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:18.289
These are the greens and you can already see

163
00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.791
how they look like because of what this extension does.

164
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:24.930
And with this code, we just performed a basic reset

165
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.390
and we also set the project-wide font definitions

166
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.680
here in the body selector

167
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.648
because they will all be inherited to their child elements.

168
00:07:33.648 --> 00:07:35.310
With that in place,

169
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.636
let's start formatting the header element.

170
00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:39.353
And remember it has the header class.

171
00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:42.687
We use the class selector and then header.

172
00:07:42.687 --> 00:07:46.287
Let's just create some space here.

173
00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:49.604
Let's start by defining the height,

174
00:07:49.604 --> 00:07:52.388
and let's set it to 95vh.

175
00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.610
In case you're not sure what this does,

176
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.266
it's basically we say that at every point,

177
00:07:57.266 --> 00:07:59.867
the height of this box, of this element,

178
00:07:59.867 --> 00:08:03.105
should be 95% of the viewport height.

179
00:08:03.105 --> 00:08:04.727
Now we could put 100 here,

180
00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:07.595
then the element would always be exactly the same height

181
00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:10.594
as the viewport, but I chose to go with 95

182
00:08:10.594 --> 00:08:15.048
to make it not 100%, but only almost 100%.

183
00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:17.855
Let's now set the background image.

184
00:08:17.855 --> 00:08:19.648
I start typing background,

185
00:08:19.648 --> 00:08:22.538
but instead of having to write all the way until background,

186
00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:25.891
and then image, I can just start writing image right now,

187
00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:28.559
because the text editor will recognize

188
00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:31.442
that I'm looking for background image.

189
00:08:31.442 --> 00:08:34.154
You see, it already recognized that that's what I want.

190
00:08:34.154 --> 00:08:36.896
And this will also work in your text editor.

191
00:08:36.896 --> 00:08:39.518
You can just do the same and you don't have to write

192
00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:41.675
all the codes, like background image,

193
00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:44.520
when instead just back img and then it works.

194
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.005
Press enter and that's it.

195
00:08:47.005 --> 00:08:48.948
The background image that we want

196
00:08:48.948 --> 00:08:51.717
is here in the image folder.

197
00:08:51.717 --> 00:08:54.531
It is called hero, I think.

198
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.397
Yeah, so that's the one we want, right?

199
00:08:56.397 --> 00:08:58.730
You see? It's this one here.

200
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.343
And we specify an image by writing url

201
00:09:05.343 --> 00:09:08.194
and then specifying the path to the image.

202
00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:10.418
Now we're currently in the CSS folder,

203
00:09:10.418 --> 00:09:12.914
so we first have to go one folder up

204
00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:14.583
to go into the project folder.

205
00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:18.500
And so it's ../ then, img, so image,

206
00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:24.849
and then the name of the image, hero.jpg

207
00:09:26.143 --> 00:09:27.430
And that's it.

208
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.594
So again, we were here in the CSS folder

209
00:09:30.594 --> 00:09:33.814
and we went one level up to go into the project folder

210
00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:35.807
so the Natours folder here,

211
00:09:35.807 --> 00:09:37.718
and then from there we went into the image folder,

212
00:09:37.718 --> 00:09:39.983
and then hero.jpg.

213
00:09:39.983 --> 00:09:41.173
And now something else we should do

214
00:09:41.173 --> 00:09:44.198
is to set the background size to cover,

215
00:09:44.198 --> 00:09:46.193
which I'm sure you're also familiar with.

216
00:09:46.193 --> 00:09:47.279
Again, I do this trick.

217
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:51.396
I just write back, then I start writing size,

218
00:09:51.396 --> 00:09:53.263
return, and that's it.

219
00:09:53.263 --> 00:09:55.814
And cover is what I want here.

220
00:09:55.814 --> 00:09:58.711
And what cover does is that whatever the width of

221
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.984
the viewport, or the element, it'll always try to fit

222
00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:04.484
the element inside of the box.

223
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:09.156
Let's now take a look on what that looks like.

224
00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:12.894
This one is it. Refresh. And here we go.

225
00:10:12.894 --> 00:10:16.806
So our background image adapts nicely to the viewport,

226
00:10:16.806 --> 00:10:17.837
I hope.

227
00:10:17.837 --> 00:10:19.337
And yeah, it does.

228
00:10:20.294 --> 00:10:22.770
And you see here this white bar,

229
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.759
it's the remaining 5% of the viewport height.

230
00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.627
100% would fill everything.

231
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.250
95 fills just up until this point.

232
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.997
And also here you can see the text,

233
00:10:32.997 --> 00:10:34.663
the some text the we put

234
00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:38.214
and it's already styled with the Lato font family,

235
00:10:38.214 --> 00:10:42.231
with the gray color and the 16 pixels in size.

236
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:44.171
Now something else we could do here

237
00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:46.678
is to set the background position.

238
00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:50.428
Background position and we can set it to top.

239
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.163
Let's see what that does.

240
00:10:55.596 --> 00:10:58.578
It looks like it did nothing, but actually it does.

241
00:10:58.578 --> 00:11:00.829
Because what it does is to ensure that whatever

242
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:04.396
the viewport size is that this top of the image here

243
00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:07.813
always stays at the top of the container.

244
00:11:09.457 --> 00:11:11.394
So you see now here, as we go up,

245
00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:13.570
the bottom of the image gets cropped,

246
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.041
but the top of the image stays the same, right?

247
00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:19.490
So it's this, what I'm talking about.

248
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.316
Now we could change it, so let's actually use the DevTools

249
00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:23.911
here right now.

250
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:26.833
Because this is a fundamental part of being a web developer

251
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:29.172
is using these Chrome DevTools.

252
00:11:29.172 --> 00:11:33.339
Let's see what it would look like if we set it to bottom.

253
00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:39.106
Now what happens is that the bottom stays the same

254
00:11:39.106 --> 00:11:41.439
as we change the image size.

255
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.827
The bottom stays the same and it changes up there.

256
00:11:46.827 --> 00:11:50.744
Now what we also can do is to set it to center.

257
00:11:52.095 --> 00:11:55.824
What it will do now is to always stay at the center.

258
00:11:55.824 --> 00:12:00.450
It will now probably crop out at the top and at the bottom.

259
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.464
So you see. Yeah, that's what happens now.

260
00:12:04.464 --> 00:12:06.625
Basically, it's in the middle here now,

261
00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:09.858
where it stays the same, but at the bottom and the top

262
00:12:09.858 --> 00:12:12.108
it is cropped out. You see?

263
00:12:13.825 --> 00:12:17.595
All right, but we of course want it at the top.

264
00:12:17.595 --> 00:12:19.946
Next up, we want that nice green gradient

265
00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:21.230
all over the image.

266
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.510
And how do we do that?

267
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.724
We use background image again, because to specify gradients,

268
00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.849
we always use the background image property.

269
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:32.264
We already have the background image property here

270
00:12:32.264 --> 00:12:33.744
with the image.

271
00:12:33.744 --> 00:12:35.172
So what can we do?

272
00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:37.337
We simply specify a second one.

273
00:12:37.337 --> 00:12:40.063
And what we do is to use the comma.

274
00:12:40.063 --> 00:12:42.606
Now we want the background to stay on top

275
00:12:42.606 --> 00:12:44.300
and so it actually has to be first

276
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.387
background image that we specify.

277
00:12:46.387 --> 00:12:47.831
We put a gradient here

278
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:51.249
and then comma, the image. Okay?

279
00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:55.172
Let's put actually the linear gradient here.

280
00:12:55.172 --> 00:12:58.190
Linear gradient and then the colors that we want.

281
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.054
And we actually have the colors up here,

282
00:13:00.054 --> 00:13:03.804
so we start with the light green on one side.

283
00:13:05.146 --> 00:13:06.719
I paste it here.

284
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:10.886
And then comma, and on the other side, the dark green.

285
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.760
Okay. Makes sense.

286
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.295
We have basically two background images,

287
00:13:17.295 --> 00:13:18.716
one on top of the other.

288
00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:20.334
The first one is the linear gradient

289
00:13:20.334 --> 00:13:22.231
going from this color to this color.

290
00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:25.824
And then after that, so basically below that,

291
00:13:25.824 --> 00:13:27.986
is this hero image.

292
00:13:27.986 --> 00:13:29.788
Now another parameter that we can specify

293
00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:32.908
in the linear gradient is basically to where

294
00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:34.301
the gradient should go.

295
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:35.968
We can say to right.

296
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:40.657
And so now CSS understands that it should start

297
00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:43.077
on the left side and go to the right.

298
00:13:43.077 --> 00:13:45.160
Let's see if that worked.

299
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.803
Close the DevTools and then reload.

300
00:13:49.803 --> 00:13:51.098
And yeah, that's it.

301
00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:53.443
So we have the gradient going from the left side.

302
00:13:53.443 --> 00:13:56.582
But the first green, lighter one, going to the right side

303
00:13:56.582 --> 00:13:58.193
with the darker green.

304
00:13:58.193 --> 00:14:02.563
Now we could also say to top or to bottom or to left,

305
00:14:02.563 --> 00:14:04.230
and we can also do something else,

306
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.478
which is specifying two directions.

307
00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:08.645
So we say to right bottom.

308
00:14:10.037 --> 00:14:13.284
And so now the gradient will go to the right bottom corner.

309
00:14:13.284 --> 00:14:16.650
Starting probably at the left top. Right?

310
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.829
Let's see if that's what happens.

311
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:20.396
And yeah, I hope you saw it change.

312
00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:23.383
So now it goes from here, all the way there.

313
00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:25.263
Only one thing left to do

314
00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:27.957
is to actually make the image below it visible, right?

315
00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:29.407
And how can we do that?

316
00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:34.151
Yeah, we have to change the opacity of these colors.

317
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:37.002
In order to do that, I can actually use the built in

318
00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.662
color picker that I have here.

319
00:14:38.662 --> 00:14:40.448
And I'm sure that your text editor,

320
00:14:40.448 --> 00:14:43.031
if you're not using Visual Studio Code,

321
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:44.835
will do the same.

322
00:14:44.835 --> 00:14:47.251
I just have to pull down this slider here,

323
00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:50.584
then until it gives me an opacity of 08.

324
00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.852
I'm sure you're familiar with this rgba syntax.

325
00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:58.128
Basically, rgba means that we have here the R, G and B,

326
00:14:58.128 --> 00:14:59.934
so red, green and blue

327
00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:02.822
and then the opacity value in the end.

328
00:15:02.822 --> 00:15:06.358
And this color picker does the conversion automatically,

329
00:15:06.358 --> 00:15:09.528
so we no longer can use this hexadecimal annotation here,

330
00:15:09.528 --> 00:15:13.445
so 28b485, but we have to change to rgba, okay?

331
00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:17.817
I'm putting 80 here,

332
00:15:17.817 --> 00:15:20.418
so basically 80% of the color is visible.

333
00:15:20.418 --> 00:15:23.297
If you went down here to like 10%,

334
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.965
it will be almost transparent.

335
00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:28.132
But we want 80% here.

336
00:15:29.335 --> 00:15:31.331
This looks a bit confusing here,

337
00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:35.159
so let's actually clean this up a bit.

338
00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:37.826
Each argument has it's own line,

339
00:15:40.175 --> 00:15:42.553
and then also this one on a separate line

340
00:15:42.553 --> 00:15:46.190
so that it's easier to read a little bit.

341
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.668
Again, we have two background images.

342
00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:50.892
First is gradient, going to right bottom

343
00:15:50.892 --> 00:15:51.966
with these two colors.

344
00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:54.491
And then the image below that.

345
00:15:54.491 --> 00:15:57.357
So let's see if that's the effect that we want.

346
00:15:57.357 --> 00:15:59.868
And yeah. That's pretty much how we want it to look like.

347
00:15:59.868 --> 00:16:02.100
Let's check. Yeah.

348
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.293
That's actually almost what it looks like.

349
00:16:04.293 --> 00:16:07.490
You see this small white thing here,

350
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.155
this small white border,

351
00:16:09.155 --> 00:16:11.523
that goes around this entire webpage?

352
00:16:11.523 --> 00:16:13.614
You see it? It's actually also here.

353
00:16:13.614 --> 00:16:15.624
You can see that here it's light gray.

354
00:16:15.624 --> 00:16:16.890
But here it's white.

355
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.146
This white thing goes around the entire webpage.

356
00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.883
I think it gives everything a very nice look.

357
00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:24.540
Let's do that as well.

358
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.237
It's actually really easy.

359
00:16:26.237 --> 00:16:28.755
All we have to do is to put a padding

360
00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:30.672
around the entire body.

361
00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.240
Padding, 30 pixels.

362
00:16:34.485 --> 00:16:36.559
The body element contains the entire webpage

363
00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.753
and so if we set a padding here,

364
00:16:38.753 --> 00:16:43.167
then this padding will get applied on the entire webpage.

365
00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:45.300
Just like this. Here we go.

366
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.467
That's our 30 pixel padding here around the webpage.

367
00:16:50.599 --> 00:16:53.978
This is not a case of inheritance, like we had here,

368
00:16:53.978 --> 00:16:56.218
because the padding is not getting inherited.

369
00:16:56.218 --> 00:16:58.569
All that's happening is that it's applying a 30 pixel

370
00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:01.152
padding around the entire body.

371
00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:04.623
And now the last piece of the styling

372
00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.995
that we want to do for the header.

373
00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:09.547
What we want is now this kind of wedge

374
00:17:09.547 --> 00:17:11.149
that we can see here.

375
00:17:11.149 --> 00:17:13.004
And what this is, is to simply clip,

376
00:17:13.004 --> 00:17:14.821
clip out this part of the image

377
00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:16.633
that would otherwise be here.

378
00:17:16.633 --> 00:17:19.029
Okay? Let's now do that.

379
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:22.272
And for that, we use the really modern CSS property

380
00:17:22.272 --> 00:17:23.689
called clip-path.

381
00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.082
So, clip-path.

382
00:17:26.082 --> 00:17:28.389
And what we're doing here is to specify a polygon

383
00:17:28.389 --> 00:17:31.877
in which the image, or the element, will still be visible.

384
00:17:31.877 --> 00:17:34.472
We use the polygon function.

385
00:17:34.472 --> 00:17:35.849
So polygon.

386
00:17:35.849 --> 00:17:38.007
And in here we define a bunch of coordinates

387
00:17:38.007 --> 00:17:40.107
which define this polygon.

388
00:17:40.107 --> 00:17:42.338
For now, let me just put some place holders here,

389
00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:45.125
like X and epsilon. X and epsilon.

390
00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:47.464
And we're gonna specify these later on.

391
00:17:47.464 --> 00:17:49.131
Okay. X and epsilon.

392
00:17:50.045 --> 00:17:52.695
But first, we need to take a look at the image to see

393
00:17:52.695 --> 00:17:55.352
how it actually should work.

394
00:17:55.352 --> 00:17:57.240
So this is our image,

395
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.825
and this is how we want the final version to look.

396
00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:02.862
All right, so what are the four coordinates of this polygon

397
00:18:02.862 --> 00:18:05.838
where we want the element to still be visible?

398
00:18:05.838 --> 00:18:08.836
It's this one here, right? So we're gonna start here.

399
00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:11.708
This one. Then here, this coordinate.

400
00:18:11.708 --> 00:18:13.594
Then this one, this corner.

401
00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:15.242
And then finally, this one.

402
00:18:15.242 --> 00:18:19.085
All we need to specify these four corners

403
00:18:19.085 --> 00:18:20.937
in order to obtain this polygon.

404
00:18:20.937 --> 00:18:23.778
And we're gonna start here at the top left corner

405
00:18:23.778 --> 00:18:25.292
and then move clockwise.

406
00:18:25.292 --> 00:18:28.130
This one first, then this one,

407
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.472
then the third one, and then the final one.

408
00:18:31.472 --> 00:18:33.341
In relation to this point here,

409
00:18:33.341 --> 00:18:35.761
where do we want the first point to be?

410
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:37.744
We want it to be exactly here, right?

411
00:18:37.744 --> 00:18:40.744
So we don't wanna move it anything in the X axis,

412
00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:43.453
so it's just like this. This is X.

413
00:18:43.453 --> 00:18:46.119 line:15% 
And we don't want it to move in the epsilon axis,

414
00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:48.224 line:15% 
so also not this way.

415
00:18:48.224 --> 00:18:49.913 line:15% 
It's just zero zero.

416
00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:52.191
You want it to stay in the same place.

417
00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:54.108
So zero and zero. Okay?

418
00:18:54.996 --> 00:18:58.638
In the X direction we don't want it to change.

419
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.480
And in the epsilon direction,

420
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.208
we also don't want it to change.

421
00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:04.542
Let's now take a look at the second point.

422
00:19:04.542 --> 00:19:06.310
So this one here.

423
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.924
Counting from here, from the left side,

424
00:19:08.924 --> 00:19:12.280
we want it to change in the X direction, right?

425
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.736
All the way until this point

426
00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:16.766
we want the polygon to go, right?

427
00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:18.033
And so what is this point here?

428
00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.344
How far away is it from the left side?

429
00:19:20.344 --> 00:19:22.547
We can simply say it's 100%.

430
00:19:22.547 --> 00:19:26.215
So it's gonna be 100% of the width of this element

431
00:19:26.215 --> 00:19:29.347
away from the left side, from here.

432
00:19:29.347 --> 00:19:33.425
We can just say that X should be 100%

433
00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:35.875
and our epsilon in the epsilon direction,

434
00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:38.040
we don't wanna change it at all, right?

435
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.593
Okay. And now the third coordinate is this one.

436
00:19:41.593 --> 00:19:44.118 line:15% 
It's the same in the X direction, right?

437
00:19:44.118 --> 00:19:46.877 line:15% 
So it's still 100% in the X direction,

438
00:19:46.877 --> 00:19:49.793 line:15% 
but now the epsilon is what changes here.

439
00:19:49.793 --> 00:19:53.626 line:15% 
Let's just put some random number there, okay?

440
00:19:55.588 --> 00:19:57.794
X is still the same, 100%.

441
00:19:57.794 --> 00:20:00.717
And now from the top, we want it to be at some point.

442
00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:03.079
Let's just say 50%.

443
00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:05.213
Or we could also specify it as in pixels

444
00:20:05.213 --> 00:20:07.406
or in any other unit that we want.

445
00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:11.017
For example, I can say 200 pixels, okay?

446
00:20:11.017 --> 00:20:14.320
All right. And now the last coordinate is this one here,

447
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.756
the fourth.

448
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:18.606
In X, we're back to zero here, right?

449
00:20:18.606 --> 00:20:20.873
Because remember that this side here is the reference.

450
00:20:20.873 --> 00:20:24.705
We don't move anything in the X direction, so this way.

451
00:20:24.705 --> 00:20:27.383
We did move, however, in the epsilon direction,

452
00:20:27.383 --> 00:20:29.099
so going from here,

453
00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:32.504
we did all the way down to the end of the element.

454
00:20:32.504 --> 00:20:34.254
So we want 100%.

455
00:20:36.495 --> 00:20:40.245
In X it's zero and in epsilon it's 100%.

456
00:20:41.662 --> 00:20:42.548
And that's it.

457
00:20:42.548 --> 00:20:45.631
So let's see if this actually worked.

458
00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:49.573
And now, here it is.

459
00:20:49.573 --> 00:20:51.225
All right. Great.

460
00:20:51.225 --> 00:20:54.189
These are the 200 pixels that we specified here

461
00:20:54.189 --> 00:20:58.266
in this coordinate for the epsilon direction.

462
00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:00.849
Let's now inspect this element.

463
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.104
And we can now change here some stuff

464
00:21:04.104 --> 00:21:06.263
so that you can see how this changes.

465
00:21:06.263 --> 00:21:08.881
Imagine that here for the second coordinate,

466
00:21:08.881 --> 00:21:12.191
so this one here, we wouldn't put 100 pixels,

467
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:14.347
but let's say, sorry.

468
00:21:14.347 --> 00:21:18.514
We wouldn't put 100%, but we would put let's say 500 pixels.

469
00:21:20.415 --> 00:21:22.045
Okay, that makes sense, right?

470
00:21:22.045 --> 00:21:25.188
Because we have 500 in the X direction

471
00:21:25.188 --> 00:21:28.021
and zero in the epsilon direction.

472
00:21:29.115 --> 00:21:31.165
Can also change that of course.

473
00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:34.280
Let's say we have 100 pixels here,

474
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.750
then it look like that.

475
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.689
All right.

476
00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:37.912
Now what I want you to try here

477
00:21:37.912 --> 00:21:39.820
is to make a triangle of this.

478
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.989
Okay?

479
00:21:40.989 --> 00:21:42.835
I'm pretty sure that after this explanation

480
00:21:42.835 --> 00:21:46.388 line:15% 
you should already understand how it works, right?

481
00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:50.555 line:15% 
Try to pause the video and try to do a triangle here, okay?

482
00:21:52.147 --> 00:21:54.264
So, did you manage to make it work?

483
00:21:54.264 --> 00:21:56.119
This is how I would do it.

484
00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:59.493
Let's just get rid of all of this.

485
00:21:59.493 --> 00:22:01.241
And now, the first coordinate

486
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:03.780
should be here in the center, right?

487
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.363
We have X 50% and on epsilon, 0%.

488
00:22:10.476 --> 00:22:12.603
And now we want this bottom corner here,

489
00:22:12.603 --> 00:22:16.770
so X is 100% and epsilon is also 100%, right?

490
00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:21.128
And now finally it's this bottom corner here.

491
00:22:21.128 --> 00:22:25.295
And so here we have X zero and epsilon is 100%.

492
00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:28.045
So zero and 100%.

493
00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:32.855
And here we go. So here we have our triangle, right?

494
00:22:32.855 --> 00:22:35.151
So if you wanna make a triangle, it's like this.

495
00:22:35.151 --> 00:22:37.704
Now you can do lots of different things with this

496
00:22:37.704 --> 00:22:39.685
and there's actually a very cool tool

497
00:22:39.685 --> 00:22:41.700
which is called Clippy, this one here.

498
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.079
And I'm gonna put it on my resource reference page

499
00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:46.080
so that you can check it out later.

500
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.595
And here you just need to click on one of these.

501
00:22:48.595 --> 00:22:51.840
Let's say we want a right arrow, like this.

502
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.606
To get a bit crazy.

503
00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:58.369
And then all we have to do is to copy this CSS code here.

504
00:22:58.369 --> 00:22:59.809
Now let's just copy these numbers

505
00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:03.976
because we already have the clip-path property written out.

506
00:23:07.026 --> 00:23:10.693
Just to make a final test, final experiment.

507
00:23:12.582 --> 00:23:14.083
It works like this. Okay.

508
00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:15.545
Now we have an arrow.

509
00:23:15.545 --> 00:23:17.421
Okay, but we don't want any arrow.

510
00:23:17.421 --> 00:23:21.557
We just want our element to look like in the example page.

511
00:23:21.557 --> 00:23:24.860
And so here, what we will do, is not to specify a percentage

512
00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.000
but a unit of viewport height.

513
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.302
Such as we did here for the height of the element.

514
00:23:30.302 --> 00:23:35.007
In here, I will say 75% of the viewport height, okay?

515
00:23:35.007 --> 00:23:38.464
So let's look how this looks like now.

516
00:23:38.464 --> 00:23:39.310
And that's it.

517
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.629
Now if we change the viewport height,

518
00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:44.621
it will also change dynamically.

519
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:46.802
This little interval here, right?

520
00:23:46.802 --> 00:23:49.503
And if I close this completely, then it looks like this.

521
00:23:49.503 --> 00:23:53.287
And it looks the exact same way as our original, right?

522
00:23:53.287 --> 00:23:55.951
See. That's how it looks like.

523
00:23:55.951 --> 00:23:57.247
Awesome.

524
00:23:57.247 --> 00:23:59.353
I know this is a bit complicated to understand

525
00:23:59.353 --> 00:24:02.231
this clip-path property and the polygon we have to write,

526
00:24:02.231 --> 00:24:04.129
but try to wrap your head around it,

527
00:24:04.129 --> 00:24:06.398
and then it's actually not so complicated.

528
00:24:06.398 --> 00:24:08.214
I hope that this first coding lecture

529
00:24:08.214 --> 00:24:09.969
of the course was quite fun

530
00:24:09.969 --> 00:24:12.020
and that you already learned something new here.

531
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.482
We're already making great progress

532
00:24:13.482 --> 00:24:14.920
and to continue with this header,

533
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.267
just come with me right to the next lecture.

534
00:24:17.267 --> 00:24:18.434
See you there.
