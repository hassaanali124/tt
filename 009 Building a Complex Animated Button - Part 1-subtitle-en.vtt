00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:02.917
<v Narrator>We're almost done building the first</v>

2
00:00:02.917 --> 00:00:06.383
section of our page, but what's missing is this cool

3
00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:09.709
animated button that I showed you right at the beginning.

4
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.296
So let's go build that.

5
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:15.016
By coding up this button, you will learn techniques

6
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:17.513
that are going to be useful in countless situations

7
00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:18.761
in the future.

8
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:20.883
So you're going to learn what pseudo-elements

9
00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:24.126
and pseudo-classes are and why they are important.

10
00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:27.228
How and why to use the after pseudo-element

11
00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:30.219
and how to build a creative hover animation effect

12
00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.419
using the transition property.

13
00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.959
So this lecture is probably going to be rather long

14
00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:38.778
but I promise you it's going to be totally worth it.

15
00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:41.831
So the button that I'm talking about is this one here.

16
00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:43.961
And so it has this nice effect you see

17
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.267
where it looks like it's getting bigger

18
00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.484
and then in the end it fades out after like

19
00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.643
half a second or something, you see?

20
00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:52.096
So this is what we're going to build.

21
00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:53.232
So it moves up a little bit and

22
00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:55.039
creates this shadow beneath it

23
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.550
and so it looks like it's moving up

24
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.181
in direction to the user.

25
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:01.433
So let's check it again.

26
00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.715
So it's like it's really moving up,

27
00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:05.466
that's why the shadow then appears.

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.782
Now, look what happens when we click it,

29
00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:10.872
so it goes down a little bit and the shadow also

30
00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:13.234
disappears a little bit as if we were really

31
00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.626
pushing it towards the page.

32
00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:17.376
Want to see it again?

33
00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:22.735
So we hover it, it elevates, and then as we click it,

34
00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:24.841
it looks like it's going back down,

35
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:26.642
and you can see it because it moves down

36
00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:29.789
and because the shadow gets a little bit smaller.

37
00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.230
So you see?

38
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.230
There it is.

39
00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:36.985
And actually moves down, but let's see it again and

40
00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:39.233
there it is, right?

41
00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.905
So let's first code up that part

42
00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:43.981
where this functionality happens

43
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:47.257
and then later we're going to care about this white part

44
00:01:47.257 --> 00:01:50.938
that looks like it's like flying out or something,

45
00:01:50.938 --> 00:01:53.387
it's growing bigger and bigger and then disappears.

46
00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:55.637
So back to our markup here,

47
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.030
remember that I was saying that we were going to

48
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.986
add something here to this text box

49
00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:03.961
and what I mean is, of course, this button.

50
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.588
So the button will be an anchor element,

51
00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:09.755
so a for now, with an href of nothing,

52
00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:15.008
so leading to nothing, which is this hash symbol

53
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:17.439
and then of course, we need to give it some class,

54
00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.552
and I'm going to call it, as usual, button,

55
00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:21.765
but at the same time, I'm giving it another class,

56
00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:25.733
calling button, white, because we're going to have

57
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:28.394
multiple buttons on the page, some will be white

58
00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:30.832
some will be green, but most of the functionality

59
00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:33.665
is the same, only the color changes and so I'm going

60
00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:37.302
to put the styles about the color here in this class

61
00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:39.023
and the stuff that doesn't change

62
00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:42.718
from the white to the green button in this button class.

63
00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:46.523
So we've done this before, at least in my other HTML course

64
00:02:46.523 --> 00:02:48.181
and so this should be nothing new to you,

65
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.244
it's just a good practice.

66
00:02:50.244 --> 00:02:52.473
Alright, and the text, which we have on this link,

67
00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:55.640
on this button, is discover our tours,

68
00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.139
just like this.

69
00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.306
And so let's now start styling the button element down here.

70
00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.922
So you see our CSS file is getting rather long,

71
00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:10.196
we're already at 121 lines here, but don't worry,

72
00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:12.199
we're going to think about architecture

73
00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.730
and all that stuff a bit later.

74
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.273
So for now, in this section, we're just focusing on

75
00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:18.881
getting this code ready here and

76
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.919
getting this header element ready

77
00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.518
and we're going to think about organizational aspects

78
00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:25.394
of our code a bit later.

79
00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:27.321
So with this, we select a button element

80
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:29.940
but since it's a link, I'm sure you already know

81
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.596
that we should do it like this.

82
00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:34.235
Alright, and what is this?

83
00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:38.245
So this here is a pseudo-class, it's the link pseudo-class.

84
00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:41.984
And pseudo-classes are a special state of a selector.

85
00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:45.118
So this link here is a state of the button selector.

86
00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:48.591
So like when a user hovers an element, or when a checkbox

87
00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:52.213
is clicked or if we want to select a last-child,

88
00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:53.984
and many other possibilities.

89
00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:56.451
So we use pseudo-classes to style elements

90
00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:57.923
under a special condition.

91
00:03:57.923 --> 00:03:59.638
And it's a very important concept

92
00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.473
that we're going to use all the time.

93
00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:04.669
So the link is a special state of a selector when it is

94
00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.879
an anchor element so it functions as a link.

95
00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.583
But there's also the visited state.

96
00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.083
So button visited.

97
00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:16.337
So this is the state when the user has already clicked

98
00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:19.379
on the button once before and then sees the button again,

99
00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.876
so that's the visited state.

100
00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:23.049
And I'm sure that you know that for example, if we don't

101
00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:26.557
style a link at all, it will appear blue in the beginning

102
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:29.260
and then once we click on it once, when we see it again,

103
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.553
then it will be purple.

104
00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.321
So that's the default styling of links

105
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:34.814
in most of the browsers.

106
00:04:34.814 --> 00:04:37.284
Now we don't want this, we want the visited state to

107
00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:40.726
look at exactly like the link state, so the normal state

108
00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:44.740
of our links and so we just put them together.

109
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.078
Now the first thing that we're going to do is to say

110
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.667
that we want the text to be uppercase,

111
00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:51.750
text transform uppercase.

112
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.410
We want there to be no text decoration.

113
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.075
Let's actually take a look so we can see

114
00:04:57.075 --> 00:04:59.447
what exactly we want to change.

115
00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:00.873
So here we go.

116
00:05:00.873 --> 00:05:02.844
So we don't want, of course, this color

117
00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.010
and we don't want this underline,

118
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.738
so let's get rid of it.

119
00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:09.420
So, text decoration and I'm sure you

120
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.977
already know all of this,

121
00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.768
that's why these properties that are not really new to you,

122
00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:18.081
I'm not really explaining what they're doing, okay?

123
00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:21.164
And then the text we want to be gray.

124
00:05:22.124 --> 00:05:24.495
Now remember that we're going to have multiple colors

125
00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.197
for the button and so in the white button,

126
00:05:27.197 --> 00:05:29.467
the text will be this dark gray,

127
00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:31.998
but in the green button, it will probably be white.

128
00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.243
And so that's something that we have to do

129
00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:34.816
in this external class.

130
00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:37.856
So let me already create that actually,

131
00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:41.811
so it's called button white, and so here we're going

132
00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:45.119
to have a background color of white, of course,

133
00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:48.580
background color, and just so I did this trick

134
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.227
where I just write a couple of letters and then the

135
00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:53.618
text editor figures our which property I want

136
00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:56.595
and this way I have to type less code.

137
00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:58.894
So white as we saw already, FFF,

138
00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:03.061
and the color should be 777 as we already used before.

139
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:07.196
Now we also want some padding around the button, of course,

140
00:06:07.196 --> 00:06:09.007
so let's specify that as well.

141
00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:11.565
And once again, I'm sure you're already familiar with how

142
00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:13.903
the shortened property of padding works.

143
00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:16.182
So we can specify only one value and then it will

144
00:06:16.182 --> 00:06:19.505
apply everywhere, so top, bottom, left, and right

145
00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:22.239
or we can also write two values.

146
00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:24.579
Then the first one will be for top and bottom

147
00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:26.930
and then second one will be for left and right.

148
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.013
So let's say 15 pixels and 40 pixels.

149
00:06:31.612 --> 00:06:33.908
So now we have a padding at the top and at the bottom of

150
00:06:33.908 --> 00:06:37.326
15 pixels and left and right, 40 pixels.

151
00:06:37.326 --> 00:06:39.456
And we could also write four numbers.

152
00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:42.249
Then the first one would be top, the second would be right,

153
00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.112
the third one would be the bottom,

154
00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.253
and the fourth one would be for the left side.

155
00:06:47.253 --> 00:06:48.576
Okay, now check this out,

156
00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:50.841
but I will tell you already that it's not going to work as

157
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:53.848
expected because it's occupying here this space

158
00:06:53.848 --> 00:06:57.016
on the top of this other text where it shouldn't.

159
00:06:57.016 --> 00:07:00.408
That's because it's right now, an inline element.

160
00:07:00.408 --> 00:07:02.532
So this button here is right now an inline element

161
00:07:02.532 --> 00:07:05.967
because it's simply text, but we should display it

162
00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.550
as an inline block.

163
00:07:08.773 --> 00:07:11.952
And this way the box model works on this element as if

164
00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:15.582
was just a normal block element, okay?

165
00:07:15.582 --> 00:07:17.499
So we should always do this if we want to

166
00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:19.484
give some paddings or some heights

167
00:07:19.484 --> 00:07:22.282
or width to elements, okay?

168
00:07:22.282 --> 00:07:24.492
Now another thing that I noticed here,

169
00:07:24.492 --> 00:07:27.867
let me just refresh this, so now it has its own space.

170
00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:30.876
Another thing that we want is this actually here to be in

171
00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:33.683
the middle of this box, right?

172
00:07:33.683 --> 00:07:34.758
So how could we do that?

173
00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:36.945
How could we achieve this button to be

174
00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:38.904
in the center of the box?

175
00:07:38.904 --> 00:07:40.825
Do you think we should use absolute positioning

176
00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:43.463
or transforms like we did before?

177
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.159
Well I don't think so because

178
00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:46.475
that would really be overkill.

179
00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:50.373
It would be way to much for this very simple problem.

180
00:07:50.373 --> 00:07:52.295
So this is an inline block element and

181
00:07:52.295 --> 00:07:55.298
so it's treated as if it was text.

182
00:07:55.298 --> 00:07:58.124
And so if it's text and we want it to be at the center

183
00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:02.291
of this box, all we have to do is to set the text box,

184
00:08:03.402 --> 00:08:05.114
I believe it's called.

185
00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:06.972
Exactly, it's text box.

186
00:08:06.972 --> 00:08:11.773
All we have to do is to set its text align property

187
00:08:11.773 --> 00:08:13.913
to the center and that's it.

188
00:08:13.913 --> 00:08:16.034
So now it's going to center the text

189
00:08:16.034 --> 00:08:20.189
that is inside of the box, including of course, the button.

190
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:23.667
So just to be sure, yeah, here it goes.

191
00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:26.912
And since we're here, let's also add here some white

192
00:08:26.912 --> 00:08:30.285
space between this heading element and the button.

193
00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:32.309
So how do we do white space?

194
00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.666
Exactly, we use the margin property.

195
00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:38.000
And in this case we just want margin at the bottom,

196
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.550
we say margin bottom and let's say we want 60 pixels.

197
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.609
Alright.

198
00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:44.696
I'm not going to check it right now,

199
00:08:44.696 --> 00:08:47.036
we're going to check it later on.

200
00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:49.026
So this is link in the visited state.

201
00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:53.020
Now let's take care actually of the hover state.

202
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.839
So button hover, so another pseudo-class to select

203
00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:01.408
a different and special state of this element.

204
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:04.079
So what do we want to happen, remember?

205
00:09:04.079 --> 00:09:07.628
The first thing is for this element to move up.

206
00:09:07.628 --> 00:09:09.305
So how can we do that?

207
00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:11.297
We use transform, such as we did before.

208
00:09:11.297 --> 00:09:13.913
So you see transform is something really, really important.

209
00:09:13.913 --> 00:09:15.981
It's an extremely important property that we're

210
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:19.300
using all the time to create cool and modern effects,

211
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.865
where elements move around or even rotate or stuff,

212
00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:26.117
so transform is really important.

213
00:09:26.117 --> 00:09:29.745
So now we want to translate it and we want it to move up.

214
00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:31.046
So which direction is that?

215
00:09:31.046 --> 00:09:32.906
X or upsilon?

216
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.955
And it's right, it's direction upsilon, of course.

217
00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:40.184
And we want it to move up so we use a negative value

218
00:09:40.184 --> 00:09:43.440
and that's because in CSS, the upsilon axis moves from

219
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.666
the top to the bottom, so it's like

220
00:09:45.666 --> 00:09:47.510
from the top to the bottom.

221
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.259
And if you want to move up, we have to go the

222
00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:51.198
other way around and so it's negative.

223
00:09:51.198 --> 00:09:53.618
So to go up, it's a negative value.

224
00:09:53.618 --> 00:09:57.147
So negative, minus three pixels in this case.

225
00:09:57.147 --> 00:09:58.534
So that's for the hover.

226
00:09:58.534 --> 00:10:01.844
Now when we clicked it, remember it looked a bit different.

227
00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:05.565
So it's the active state remember, when we click an element

228
00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:07.539
then that's called the active state.

229
00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:09.594
So it's the active pseudo-class.

230
00:10:09.594 --> 00:10:12.961
So remember what it looked like when we clicked it?

231
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:17.187
Again, it's a translate because again, it moved

232
00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:21.187
and this time we're only moving it one pixel up.

233
00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:24.535
So this one pixel up, so this minus one pixel

234
00:10:24.535 --> 00:10:28.627
is in relation to the initial state, so to the link state,

235
00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:29.574
not to the hover.

236
00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:30.838
So it's not minus one pixel

237
00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:33.119
in relation to the hover state, but

238
00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:38.024
it's always here related to the initial link state, okay?

239
00:10:38.024 --> 00:10:40.024
So let's check that out.

240
00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:44.662
So the margin is there and we hover so it goes up.

241
00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:46.857
No animation so far but it goes up

242
00:10:46.857 --> 00:10:51.063
and when we click, it goes down a bit, right?

243
00:10:51.063 --> 00:10:51.896
So, cool.

244
00:10:51.896 --> 00:10:54.907
Now all we have to do is to animate this and then

245
00:10:54.907 --> 00:10:56.824
also add these shadows.

246
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.596
But first let's actually add the rounded corners.

247
00:11:00.596 --> 00:11:04.777
So border radius, and here we can put a really high number,

248
00:11:04.777 --> 00:11:07.407
like let's say even 100 pixels or something and then

249
00:11:07.407 --> 00:11:11.041
what it will do is to simply shape it like this here

250
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:12.197
on the edges.

251
00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:14.321
So if you put 200 or 500 pixels,

252
00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:18.127
it will all still be the same, okay?

253
00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:20.989
So now all we have to do is the small animation.

254
00:11:20.989 --> 00:11:22.927
So remember that in the last lecture,

255
00:11:22.927 --> 00:11:25.581
I said that there are two types of animations.

256
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:28.527
The first one is to simply use the transition property,

257
00:11:28.527 --> 00:11:31.174
which is the easy one, and the more complex one is

258
00:11:31.174 --> 00:11:32.658
the method that we used,

259
00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.633
which was to really specify the steps of the

260
00:11:34.633 --> 00:11:37.511
animations with the keyframes at-rule.

261
00:11:37.511 --> 00:11:39.991
Now in this case, that's not necessary, is all.

262
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.629
All we have to do is use the transition property,

263
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:45.945
transition, now we have to just specify

264
00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:49.079
which properties we want to animate.

265
00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.942
And if we're not really sure, or if we don't want to

266
00:11:50.942 --> 00:11:53.124
write them out, we can simply say all.

267
00:11:53.124 --> 00:11:55.294
So in this case, all the properties

268
00:11:55.294 --> 00:11:57.544
are enabled to be animated.

269
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:01.124
Then we can also specify a time that we want.

270
00:12:01.124 --> 00:12:04.096
Let's say that we want 0.2 seconds.

271
00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:08.170
So this is already the shorthand version of the transition.

272
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.904
So just like before here where we had a shorthand for

273
00:12:10.904 --> 00:12:14.394
animation, instead of writing out all of these properties,

274
00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:15.543
we do the same with transition.

275
00:12:15.543 --> 00:12:18.911
We just write all of these possibilities here in the same

276
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:23.045
property as a shorthand because it's just easier.

277
00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:25.111
It's another transform on the hover as well as

278
00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.775
on the active will be animated in relation

279
00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:29.437
to their initial state.

280
00:12:29.437 --> 00:12:32.496
And this is actually causes sometimes a lot of confusion

281
00:12:32.496 --> 00:12:34.708
as to why the transition property

282
00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:37.121
has to be on the initial state.

283
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:39.160
But that's just how it works.

284
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.939
So on the initial states, we say that there can be

285
00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:44.615
a transition basically on all the properties

286
00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:47.342
and then on the hover, so here we say, how it should

287
00:12:47.342 --> 00:12:50.884
look like in the hover state and in the active state

288
00:12:50.884 --> 00:12:53.798
and then the animation is going to happen.

289
00:12:53.798 --> 00:12:56.005
So let's take a look at that.

290
00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:57.069
And yeah, here we go.

291
00:12:57.069 --> 00:13:01.152
So now it moves up and very nicely it moves down,

292
00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:03.432
just like this, okay.

293
00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:05.624
Now all we have to do is to add the box shadow

294
00:13:05.624 --> 00:13:09.238
and this also when we do the hover.

295
00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:13.023
And so in the box shadow property, we can specify

296
00:13:13.023 --> 00:13:15.174
a bunch of values.

297
00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:18.654
So the first one is the offset in the x direction.

298
00:13:18.654 --> 00:13:21.420
And since we don't want any shadow in the x direction,

299
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.747
you only want it in the upsilon direction,

300
00:13:23.747 --> 00:13:25.802
we put a zero here.

301
00:13:25.802 --> 00:13:28.048
Now in upsilon, which is the second one, we actually

302
00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:31.108
want some offset, so 10 pixels let's say.

303
00:13:31.108 --> 00:13:33.938
So the shadow will be 10 pixels down.

304
00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:37.256
Then the third value is the blur that we want to see.

305
00:13:37.256 --> 00:13:40.872
And let's say 20 pixels so we have a really high blur here.

306
00:13:40.872 --> 00:13:42.869
And this makes for a more blurry shadow

307
00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:44.747
so it looks like we're further away.

308
00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:48.735
And so in the active box shadow, we're then

309
00:13:48.735 --> 00:13:50.528
going to reduce that blur and

310
00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:55.430
then it looks like we're back closer to the page, okay?

311
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.001
And here now, finally, we can put a color.

312
00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:02.030
So an RGBA in this case because we want the color of the

313
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.359
shadow to be transparent.

314
00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:07.177
So here we put it to black, complete black,

315
00:14:07.177 --> 00:14:11.316
and then let's just put a transparency value.

316
00:14:11.316 --> 00:14:13.887
So this is black, but not completely black,

317
00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:16.824
but only with 20% opacity, in order to make it

318
00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:20.047
just a very subtle shadow and not all too visible.

319
00:14:20.047 --> 00:14:22.479
We want it to be very subtle, okay?

320
00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:24.830
Now you can play around then with different numbers

321
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.400
to see how it's going to look like if you make it darker,

322
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.415
if you make it less opaque.

323
00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:32.220
20% I think is a good way to go.

324
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.603
Now remember, when we click on the button,

325
00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:37.665
so when it's active, we want the shadow to look smaller

326
00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:40.248
and so to give the impression that the button is closer

327
00:14:40.248 --> 00:14:42.896
to the page and so further away from the user.

328
00:14:42.896 --> 00:14:46.016
So let's decrease this here to five and then we also

329
00:14:46.016 --> 00:14:47.766
want it less blurred.

330
00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:51.083
So let's say 10 pixels here, okay?

331
00:14:51.083 --> 00:14:53.427
So I'm doing this from my experience because I have

332
00:14:53.427 --> 00:14:56.632
a lot of experience by playing around with these values

333
00:14:56.632 --> 00:14:59.604
so if this looks a bit like magic to you, then don't worry,

334
00:14:59.604 --> 00:15:01.612
it comes with practice.

335
00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:03.673
And so again, you should just play around with these numbers

336
00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:06.514
and take a look how things behave

337
00:15:06.514 --> 00:15:09.414
if you change the values, okay?

338
00:15:09.414 --> 00:15:12.081
Now let's just take a look.

339
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:16.614
And yeah, so you see the shadow coming up, right?

340
00:15:16.614 --> 00:15:19.720
And now when we click it, it goes down like this.

341
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.687
So we lose a bit of shadow and it also becomes less blurry.

342
00:15:24.687 --> 00:15:27.404
Just to show you how it would look like with one pixel,

343
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:29.321
for example, let's see.

344
00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:34.546
So you see, there's a lot less blur now, right?

345
00:15:34.546 --> 00:15:35.774
But we want a little bit of blur

346
00:15:35.774 --> 00:15:37.550
to make it look more natural,

347
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.111
and so let's put that 10 pixel that we had before.

348
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:42.282
Okay and with that we have the

349
00:15:42.282 --> 00:15:44.627
first part of the button ready.

350
00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:46.959
Now to build the second part of this button,

351
00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:49.283
which includes some more animation effects,

352
00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:52.616
just join me right in the next lecture.
