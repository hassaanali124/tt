00:00:01.461 --> 00:00:03.760
<v Instructor>Before writing a single line of code,</v>

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.603
of course we need to have our tools set up

3
00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:09.505
and the tools we need are a code editor,

4
00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:12.024
as well as a browser to test the project

5
00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:13.941
that we're gonna build.

6
00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:16.487
I bought the code editor.

7
00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:19.214
Since you signed up for an advanced (mumbles) course,

8
00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:20.700
I'm absolutely sure that you have already

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.029
some code editor set up for yourself.

10
00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.857
I am currently using Visual Studio Code

11
00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:29.350
and so that's the code editor that I'm going to use

12
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.009
throughout this course.

13
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.679
Visual Studio Code is a relatively new code editor

14
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.962
and in my opinion, it's amazing.

15
00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:40.419
It's a really great, great code editor.

16
00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:42.608
It has this excellent auto-complete feature

17
00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:45.070
which they call IntelliSense.

18
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.340
Is has built-in Git supports, so if you are using Git,

19
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.991
you can use it right in the code editor.

20
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:53.841
And it also works extremely well with extensions.

21
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.266
It has a lot of great extensions and they work a lot better,

22
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.930
a lot smoother than in other code editors

23
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.450
that I have tried out.

24
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.333
So as you can maybe hear, I'm really in love

25
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.427
with this code editor and it's the best one

26
00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:07.176
I've ever tried out.

27
00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:10.052
But as I was saying, you probably have a code editor

28
00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:11.806
already set up for yourself.

29
00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:13.251
And if you're really happy with that,

30
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.940
then you should absolutely continue using that.

31
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.842
So no matter if you're using Atom or Brackets

32
00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:21.906
or Sublime or whatever text editor you're using,

33
00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:23.484
it doesn't matter because the results

34
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.458
will always be the same.

35
00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:27.374
So again, if you're happy with the editor

36
00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:28.610
you're using right now,

37
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.068
you already have it really customized for yourself,

38
00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:33.056
then just keep using that one.

39
00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:34.810
But if you're not really happy

40
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.417
or if you want to try something new,

41
00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:39.452
then I would encourage you to try Visual Studio Code.

42
00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:41.956
It's a fantastic experience for developers.

43
00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.047
If you want to know more about my setup,

44
00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:46.564
like which theme I use and which extensions

45
00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:49.232
I have installed and use on a daily basis,

46
00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:52.043
then just head over to my blog and there you're gonna find

47
00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:54.136
a post with my setup.

48
00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:55.979
I will also put the link to this post

49
00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.650
on my resources page very soon.

50
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.213
Now about the browser, I'm using Google Chrome

51
00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:04.201
to test my webpages, and of course that's what I'm gonna do

52
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:05.867
in this course as well.

53
00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:08.136
So, I encourage you to use Google Chrome as well,

54
00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:09.913
if you're not already doing it.

55
00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:12.450
Also, because it's the most used browser in the world,

56
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.599
so you really can't go wrong by using it

57
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.340
and also, you want to see how the web page

58
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.069
is going to look like exactly for the majority of the users,

59
00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.958
since Google Chrome is the most used browser in the world.

60
00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.855
So for the code editor, I'm using Visual Studio Code,

61
00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.450
but you can use whatever editor you want,

62
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.941
and for the browser, you should use Google Chrome

63
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:34.274
so that we're on the same page.

64
00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:35.865
Also we are using the (mumbles) tools

65
00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:38.840
so that we are always looking at the same thing.`

66
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.878
All right, so I think we are all set up now

67
00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:44.296
and we're ready to start with the project right now.

68
00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:48.463
So hit play on that next video and see you in a second.
