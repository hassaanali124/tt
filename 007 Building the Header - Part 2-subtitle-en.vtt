00:00:01.092 --> 00:00:02.834
<v Instructor>In this lecture, we are gonna continue</v>

2
00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:05.810
building the header section of our project

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.540
using some CSS properties that you're already familiar with.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.873
And you're also gonna learn the easiest

5
00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:15.040
way to center anything in CSS with transform, top, and left.

6
00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:18.422
Which is something really important.

7
00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:21.502
So, this is where we left after the last lecture.

8
00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:24.570
So let's now take a look at the final product.

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.404
And so what we're gonna do in this lecture,

10
00:00:26.404 --> 00:00:28.815
is to just add this small logo here.

11
00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.760
And then, we're also going to add this heading here.

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.558
So this is the plan for this lecture

13
00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.267
And let's start with the image.

14
00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:38.826
So first off, in the HTML,

15
00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:41.433
we actually have to add that image.

16
00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.438
So let's remove the text here.

17
00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:47.045
And what I'm gonna do now is to add first a DIV,

18
00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:50.437
and then inside that DIV is where I'm gonna put an image.

19
00:00:50.437 --> 00:00:52.917
Because the image is actually an inline element,

20
00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:55.039
and so I think it's a better practice

21
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.936
to first have a small container

22
00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.539
where this image is inside,

23
00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.325
and then position that container

24
00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:03.457
to where we want the image and the container to be.

25
00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:07.624
So first, I'm writing a DIV with a class of logo box.

26
00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:15.319
And then in here, I'm going to put the image.

27
00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.288
So we go into the image folder, so IMG,

28
00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:19.675
and then from here,

29
00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:23.484
the logo that we want is called logo white.

30
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.244
So it's this one here.

31
00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:27.661
So, IMG, and then logo white.

32
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.452
And then we also give it an alt attribute.

33
00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:36.415
And remember that the alt attribute is

34
00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:39.349
to describe the image for SEO,

35
00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.024
so Search Engine Optimization,

36
00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:44.769
but also for the case that somehow the image fails to load,

37
00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:48.360
then on the website instead of the image appears this text,

38
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.076
so that users can still see

39
00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:52.927
what the image that isn't there is all about.

40
00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:55.575
So I'm just gonna put here logo.

41
00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:59.703
I'm also going to add a class and call it just logo.

42
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:03.126
So we have a logo box and then logo.

43
00:02:03.126 --> 00:02:04.959
So let's now style it.

44
00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.600
So first the logo box.

45
00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:14.730
And then the logo after that.

46
00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:20.183
And remember where we want to put the image.

47
00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:22.328
So it's here in this corner.

48
00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:24.888
And so one good way of doing this

49
00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:27.089
is to use absolute positioning.

50
00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.795
And I'm once again sure that you already

51
00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:31.286
know how absolute positioning works,

52
00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:33.407
but in the next section there is a big lecture

53
00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:34.974
which talks about the difference between

54
00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:37.152
absolute and relative positioning,

55
00:02:37.152 --> 00:02:39.415
and the normal flow and floats,

56
00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:40.849
and all of that stuff,

57
00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.280
so that you really understand how

58
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.218
all of this works behind the scenes.

59
00:02:44.218 --> 00:02:45.051
Okay.

60
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:49.561
But for now, let's just simply use the position absolute,

61
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.496
like you already know how to do.

62
00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:55.238
And we can then use top, bottom, left, and right properties

63
00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:58.352
to put the image exactly where we want it to be.

64
00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:02.927
So, let's say we want the top to be 40 pixels,

65
00:03:02.927 --> 00:03:06.175
and the left to be 40 pixels.

66
00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:08.657
Now, where does this measurement actually start?

67
00:03:08.657 --> 00:03:13.163
So, from where, counting from where, is these 40 pixels?

68
00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:15.389
And also these 40 pixels.

69
00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.606
There has to be some kind of reference, right?

70
00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:20.663
So, the place from which we start to count 40 pixels

71
00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:24.022
to the left, and 40 pixels from the top.

72
00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:24.855
Right?

73
00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.316
And that reference is a parent element,

74
00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:30.295
which has its position set to relative.

75
00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:32.125
And so we should also do that.

76
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:34.909
And remember that the header is the parent element, right?

77
00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.027
So, logo box and the parent is the header.

78
00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:39.814
And so we should go to header

79
00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:42.295
and set its position to relative.

80
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:44.286
Position relative.

81
00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.411
So now this is the origin, so the reference,

82
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:50.379
from which top and left start to count.

83
00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.575
Okay.

84
00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:54.485
Now just before we check if this already looks good,

85
00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:58.649
let's just specify the size of the image itself.

86
00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:00.982
So we say height, 35 pixels.

87
00:04:02.914 --> 00:04:04.058
That will be okay.

88
00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:06.249
And then the width we'll scale accordingly.

89
00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.837
So we don't even have to specify it.

90
00:04:07.837 --> 00:04:09.357
All we do is to specify the height,

91
00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:11.311
and the width will be automatically

92
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:13.194
figured out by the browser.

93
00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:14.961
We could instead also set the width

94
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:17.143
and then the height would be figured out by the browser.

95
00:04:17.143 --> 00:04:18.921
But I prefer to do it like this.

96
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:23.005
I always prefer to control the height of the elements.

97
00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:25.850
So let's now take a look.

98
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.255
And indeed, there it is.

99
00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.701
Okay. So this part is completed.

100
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.773
Let's now take care of this primary heading

101
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:33.802
that we have here.

102
00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:35.802
So this one here, right.

103
00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:39.329
So back to the HTML,

104
00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:44.257
right after this logo box we will have our primary heading.

105
00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:47.487
So I'm going to use the H one element,

106
00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.820
and call it heading primary.

107
00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:55.885
Alright.

108
00:04:55.885 --> 00:04:57.759
Now, let's actually go back

109
00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.994
to take a look at how we want this.

110
00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:02.732
So we want this basically to have two parts.

111
00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:06.239
So we have this entire text here, but this is all the H one.

112
00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.500
Remember that the H one is the single most important

113
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.446
heading on the page,

114
00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:14.496
which is important for Google or for any other search engine

115
00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:16.977
to figure out what our webpage is all about.

116
00:05:16.977 --> 00:05:18.577
And so it's important that we basically

117
00:05:18.577 --> 00:05:21.138
put the title of our webpage in there.

118
00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:24.325
Now we could only just put outdoors in there,

119
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:26.875
so make this the H one, and then for example,

120
00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.482
make an H two here for the secondary header,

121
00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:32.339
and put this is where life happens in there.

122
00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:33.263
But that's not what we want,

123
00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:35.577
because we don't want our primary text

124
00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:38.693
or title of the website to say just outdoors.

125
00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:40.928
We want all of this text.

126
00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:43.807
And so we must somehow divide this text.

127
00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:45.583
So, what are we going to do?

128
00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:47.502
We are going to use this span element.

129
00:05:47.502 --> 00:05:49.544
And this span element is perfect for this

130
00:05:49.544 --> 00:05:51.675
because remember that a span

131
00:05:51.675 --> 00:05:54.489
is simply to style some text different.

132
00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:56.817
And so we can just put two span elements in here,

133
00:05:56.817 --> 00:05:57.803
one for each part.

134
00:05:57.803 --> 00:06:00.337
One for the top, and one for the bottom.

135
00:06:00.337 --> 00:06:03.587
So span, class, heading, primary, main.

136
00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.686
And then the same

137
00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:11.519
for

138
00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:14.769
the part on the bottom.

139
00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:17.040
Let's call it sub.

140
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.392
So the first one says outdoors.

141
00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:23.475
And down here, is where life happens.

142
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.024
So that's basically the slogan of the company.

143
00:06:28.024 --> 00:06:31.334
And with that, we're good to go, and to format this text.

144
00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:35.084
So, heading, primary, let me already copy it.

145
00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:42.481
And then also

146
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.472
main,

147
00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:49.276
and then also for the sub.

148
00:06:51.457 --> 00:06:55.355
So the first thing that we want is the color to be white.

149
00:06:55.355 --> 00:06:58.672
And that is just this fff code.

150
00:06:58.672 --> 00:07:02.782
So in RGB fff is basically the same as saying this one here.

151
00:07:02.782 --> 00:07:03.615
Okay.

152
00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:06.654
And you see that both of them are the complete white.

153
00:07:06.654 --> 00:07:10.007
So the presence of all the colors at the same time.

154
00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:14.412
So it's complete red, complete green, and complete blue.

155
00:07:14.412 --> 00:07:15.245
Okay.

156
00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:16.573
But this is enough.

157
00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:19.697
Now another thing that we want is to text the uppercase,

158
00:07:19.697 --> 00:07:22.780
so we say text, transform, uppercase.

159
00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:26.615
And for now that should be enough.

160
00:07:26.615 --> 00:07:28.532
Let's just take a look.

161
00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:32.148
And alright.

162
00:07:32.148 --> 00:07:34.455
So our text is already here, it's already white.

163
00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:36.470
It's not quite where we want it to be,

164
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.828
but we're gonna take care of that later.

165
00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:40.157
Next, what we want to do,

166
00:07:40.157 --> 00:07:42.464
is to put this on top, and this below it.

167
00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:43.297
Right?

168
00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:44.196
So we want outdoors on top,

169
00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:46.220
and then after that this part here.

170
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.432
Also this text should be bigger, and this one smaller.

171
00:07:49.432 --> 00:07:52.820
And also, as you see, it has this huge spacing here.

172
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.742
So I did this to make it look really big,

173
00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:57.105
to give it some space to breathe.

174
00:07:57.105 --> 00:07:59.297
I think this looks like outdoors.

175
00:07:59.297 --> 00:08:01.745
It looks great with all this spacing.

176
00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:03.987
That's why I decided to go this way.

177
00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:06.584
Let's style it like this,

178
00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:08.009
in the code here.

179
00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.193
So, what should we do in order to put

180
00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:13.298
these two parts of the text, one under another?

181
00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:16.282
Do you have any idea of a good way of doing this?

182
00:08:16.282 --> 00:08:17.901
I think the best way is to display

183
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.276
them both as block level elements.

184
00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:22.188
Because remember that block elements

185
00:08:22.188 --> 00:08:24.932
occupy the entire width that they have available.

186
00:08:24.932 --> 00:08:26.806
And more importantly for this case,

187
00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:30.347
they create line breaks after and before them.

188
00:08:30.347 --> 00:08:32.470
And so that's exactly what we want.

189
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.572
So a span element is by default, an inline element.

190
00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:37.217
So it's just like text.

191
00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.557
And so we use the display property.

192
00:08:39.557 --> 00:08:42.919
Display, and display it as a block.

193
00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.752
Simple as that.

194
00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:47.909
And the same thing down here for the other span element.

195
00:08:47.909 --> 00:08:49.909
Display, and also block.

196
00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:52.396
So that solves that part.

197
00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:55.556
Now they need different font sizes.

198
00:08:55.556 --> 00:08:59.185
So let's set this one to 60 pixels.

199
00:08:59.185 --> 00:09:01.518
Give it a font white of 400.

200
00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:07.921
Because by default, the H one has a higher font white, okay.

201
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.956
And then we also give it the letter spacing of,

202
00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:12.706
let's say, 35 pixels.

203
00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.020
Okay. And now similar specifications down here

204
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.520
for the sub-part of the H one.

205
00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:24.593
So a font size in this case of 20 pixels,

206
00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:26.843
font weight of 400 as well.

207
00:09:29.804 --> 00:09:33.414
And the letter spacing, I'm going to put it to 15 pixels,

208
00:09:33.414 --> 00:09:35.862
just to try it out, and if it doesn't look good,

209
00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:39.828
we can always come back and adjust it.

210
00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:42.209
So, I'm gonna reload.

211
00:09:42.209 --> 00:09:44.290
And alright, it already looks pretty good.

212
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.290
Let's take a look at the inspector here, so,

213
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.265
to see what's happening here.

214
00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:50.828
And indeed, so this is now a block,

215
00:09:50.828 --> 00:09:51.841
and this is another block.

216
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.709
It occupies 100% of the width,

217
00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:56.505
as you can see in the blue box,

218
00:09:56.505 --> 00:09:58.660
exactly like a block element should behave.

219
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.364
And of course this also forces them into another line.

220
00:10:02.364 --> 00:10:06.653
Now we need to slightly increase the letter spacing here.

221
00:10:06.653 --> 00:10:08.070
So 17 looks good.

222
00:10:08.977 --> 00:10:10.144
Maybe 17 five.

223
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.110
17 four.

224
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.119
Okay.

225
00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:14.574
That looks about right.

226
00:10:14.574 --> 00:10:15.788
So let's memorize this.

227
00:10:15.788 --> 00:10:17.157
So 7.4.

228
00:10:17.157 --> 00:10:19.851
And then also the weight of the font here

229
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:23.142
looks a bit too thin here compared to that one, okay.

230
00:10:23.142 --> 00:10:24.822
So let's also increase that.

231
00:10:24.822 --> 00:10:27.239
So the other spacing is 17.4.

232
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:30.006
17.4 pixels.

233
00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:32.162
And now let's take a look at which weight

234
00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:33.139
we actually have available.

235
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:36.562
So we have 100, 300, 400, 700, and 900.

236
00:10:36.562 --> 00:10:38.500
So these are the font weight

237
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.340
that are loaded for this specific lotto font.

238
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.923
So we had 400, so let's now jump up to 700.

239
00:10:48.143 --> 00:10:50.486
Taking a look again.

240
00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:53.299
And yeah, so this looks much better now.

241
00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:55.183
Alright. And with that formatted,

242
00:10:55.183 --> 00:10:57.954
we should now find a way to make this displayed

243
00:10:57.954 --> 00:10:59.485
exactly in the center.

244
00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:02.750
Now of course, this should stay exactly in the center

245
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.827
no matter what the screen size is.

246
00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:06.359
So no matter the width,

247
00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:10.219
and no matter the height of the window, right.

248
00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:12.535
No matter what height we have for the screen,

249
00:11:12.535 --> 00:11:15.273
we always want this to stay in the middle.

250
00:11:15.273 --> 00:11:17.860
Because of course, we're building a responsive website here.

251
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.612
And more about that later, again.

252
00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:21.688
But for now, what we need to focus on,

253
00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:25.023
is to put this text here, exactly here in the center.

254
00:11:25.023 --> 00:11:27.945
So let's find out how we're gonna do that.

255
00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:31.766
Now, first off, let's go back to our markup here in HTML,

256
00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:32.821
because we're actually going to

257
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:36.392
put all of this in a different box, in a container,

258
00:11:36.392 --> 00:11:38.338
because we're gonna add something more

259
00:11:38.338 --> 00:11:40.370
into this box later on.

260
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.747
I can actually show you,

261
00:11:41.747 --> 00:11:43.688
we're going to add this button here,

262
00:11:43.688 --> 00:11:44.568
also in the same box,

263
00:11:44.568 --> 00:11:47.340
which also should stay in the center by then.

264
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.316
Alright.

265
00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:51.318
So we cannot just center this part here,

266
00:11:51.318 --> 00:11:54.468
but we're going to center an entire box.

267
00:11:54.468 --> 00:11:57.618
Like this. I'm going to show you.

268
00:11:57.618 --> 00:12:00.241
So this entire box here

269
00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:02.408
is what we're going to do,

270
00:12:04.316 --> 00:12:05.483
and to center.

271
00:12:06.674 --> 00:12:08.507
So, let's just call it

272
00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:11.380
text box for now.

273
00:12:13.478 --> 00:12:16.542
And then I'm gonna put all of this

274
00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:17.375
inside.

275
00:12:18.556 --> 00:12:23.040
So, text box is what we're gonna style next.

276
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.082
I'm putting it here just to follow

277
00:12:24.082 --> 00:12:26.582
the natural order of the HTML.

278
00:12:30.075 --> 00:12:31.413
So, text box.

279
00:12:31.413 --> 00:12:34.395
So, what is the best way to exactly center that box

280
00:12:34.395 --> 00:12:37.397
in the middle of our header?

281
00:12:37.397 --> 00:12:39.103
And the answer is that, once again,

282
00:12:39.103 --> 00:12:41.383
we're going to use absolute positioning.

283
00:12:41.383 --> 00:12:42.216
Alright?

284
00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:44.856
So, position absolute again.

285
00:12:44.856 --> 00:12:47.234
Now about the top, and the left.

286
00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.200
They will have to be a bit different.

287
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.509
And I'm going to show you how.

288
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:53.412
So, we start by saying top 50%,

289
00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:54.912
and left 50%.

290
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:59.854
And just to illustrate this a bit better,

291
00:12:59.854 --> 00:13:03.014
I will actually put a background color here, okay.

292
00:13:03.014 --> 00:13:04.431
Background color.

293
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.387
Something, it doesn't really matter.

294
00:13:07.387 --> 00:13:08.962
So I'm just putting red here.

295
00:13:08.962 --> 00:13:11.697
And now I'm going to show you what happens.

296
00:13:11.697 --> 00:13:14.233
Alright, so this is not quite where we want it to be.

297
00:13:14.233 --> 00:13:15.066
Right?

298
00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:17.105
But actually the code did what we wanted.

299
00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:20.732
Because this here is clearly 50% from the left.

300
00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:22.551
This part of the box.

301
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.812
Which is where the measure starts.

302
00:13:24.812 --> 00:13:26.747
So where the 50% starts counting.

303
00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:28.754
It's from this side, all the way to this side.

304
00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:29.587
And it's 50%.

305
00:13:29.587 --> 00:13:31.622
It's half of the element.

306
00:13:31.622 --> 00:13:32.455
Half of the header.

307
00:13:32.455 --> 00:13:34.509
That's what left 50% means.

308
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:37.703
It's 50% of the width of the parent element.

309
00:13:37.703 --> 00:13:39.155
And it's actually working.

310
00:13:39.155 --> 00:13:41.921
And the same thing applies to the top.

311
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.431
So it's from here to here,

312
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:44.946
it's actually 50%.

313
00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:47.549
It's half of the height of the parent.

314
00:13:47.549 --> 00:13:49.337
Now what we wanna do in order for this

315
00:13:49.337 --> 00:13:50.858
to be exactly in the center,

316
00:13:50.858 --> 00:13:52.716
is to shift this just a little bit,

317
00:13:52.716 --> 00:13:54.678
so that the center of this box

318
00:13:54.678 --> 00:13:56.378
is here in the center, is here.

319
00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.030
That's where we want it.

320
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.109
So we want this middle of the box to be just here

321
00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:02.290
where now the beginning of the box is.

322
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.694
And the same thing applies to the height.

323
00:14:04.694 --> 00:14:06.377
So we want this center here of the box,

324
00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:07.870
this horizontal center,

325
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.187
we want it to be here where the box now begins.

326
00:14:11.187 --> 00:14:12.020
So another way,

327
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.006
what we want is to translate this entire box.

328
00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:17.004
And it's actually pretty easy to do.

329
00:14:17.004 --> 00:14:21.114
We just need to use the transform property in CSS.

330
00:14:21.114 --> 00:14:23.577
Transform, and translate.

331
00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:24.961
Translate.

332
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:26.730
And now we just need to specify how much we

333
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.862
wanna translate on x and on epsilon.

334
00:14:29.862 --> 00:14:33.529
And what we want is minus 50% for both.

335
00:14:35.442 --> 00:14:36.275
And that's it.

336
00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:39.604
And that's because these 50% are now no longer

337
00:14:39.604 --> 00:14:41.335
in relation to the parent element,

338
00:14:41.335 --> 00:14:42.751
but of the element itself.

339
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:45.674
And so if we say we want minus 50%,

340
00:14:45.674 --> 00:14:49.141
it will be shifted half of the width to the left side.

341
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:50.382
And the same for the height.

342
00:14:50.382 --> 00:14:52.909
So minus 50% says that it will be shifted

343
00:14:52.909 --> 00:14:56.576
50% of the element's height to the top.

344
00:14:58.127 --> 00:14:58.960
And so,

345
00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:00.908
and so here it is.

346
00:15:00.908 --> 00:15:02.555
It's now exactly at the middle.

347
00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:03.528
Vertically,

348
00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.910
and also horizontally.

349
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.194
It's completely in the middle now.

350
00:15:07.194 --> 00:15:09.260
Now because of this wedge that we cut out here,

351
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.236
it looks a bit weird.

352
00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:13.493
It looks like it's actually more down

353
00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:15.578
than where it should be, right?

354
00:15:15.578 --> 00:15:18.221
It looks like it should be like somewhere here.

355
00:15:18.221 --> 00:15:20.279
And so instead of shifting it down 50%,

356
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.059
maybe we can just do 40%.

357
00:15:23.059 --> 00:15:26.046
We stated the top to be 40%,

358
00:15:26.046 --> 00:15:29.783
and then that should fix our problem.

359
00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:32.537
So this looks actually a lot better.

360
00:15:32.537 --> 00:15:35.670
And just to confirm that everything works as expected,

361
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.226
we can just see that this nicely adapts

362
00:15:39.226 --> 00:15:42.287
to when we decrease the screen size.

363
00:15:42.287 --> 00:15:44.505
The same, we'll just do it like this,

364
00:15:44.505 --> 00:15:47.048
the same happens with the view port height.

365
00:15:47.048 --> 00:15:48.588
So it always stays nicely,

366
00:15:48.588 --> 00:15:49.574
not exactly in the center,

367
00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.025
but

368
00:15:51.025 --> 00:15:53.015
at these 40% top

369
00:15:53.015 --> 00:15:55.322
where we specified it to be.

370
00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:56.155
Alright.

371
00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.273
So you learned a great new trick.

372
00:15:57.273 --> 00:15:58.656
Maybe you had already used it

373
00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:01.340
because I taught it in my other course as well.

374
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.284
But I think I didn't explain it this well.

375
00:16:03.284 --> 00:16:04.595
So I thought it was important

376
00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:07.089
to make it really clear how this works.

377
00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:08.389
Because it's really important.

378
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:11.038
You can now use these concepts for other things.

379
00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:14.426
Because now you totally understand how this worked.

380
00:16:14.426 --> 00:16:17.610
So again, just to make everything 100% sure.

381
00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.874
These 40% and these 50%,

382
00:16:19.874 --> 00:16:23.079
they are in relation to the parent element.

383
00:16:23.079 --> 00:16:25.248
So 50% of the parent element

384
00:16:25.248 --> 00:16:28.778
is where the text box was located to the left side.

385
00:16:28.778 --> 00:16:31.386
But, on the transform here, when we translated,

386
00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:34.075
this is in relation to the element itself.

387
00:16:34.075 --> 00:16:35.368
And this makes it possible

388
00:16:35.368 --> 00:16:37.821
that the element is exactly at the center.

389
00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:38.654
Alright.

390
00:16:38.654 --> 00:16:40.311
And that's enough for this lecture.

391
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:42.458
Next time, we're going to do this

392
00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.978
little nice animation that we see here

393
00:16:44.978 --> 00:16:46.668
when we reload the page.

394
00:16:46.668 --> 00:16:47.712
So, this.

395
00:16:47.712 --> 00:16:50.291
You saw it coming in from the left side,

396
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:51.427
and this one from the right side.

397
00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.741
Let's do it again.

398
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:55.685
This entrance animation.

399
00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:57.321
That's what we're going to do next,

400
00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:59.214
which is really exciting I think.

401
00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:02.381
So stay tuned and see you in a second.
