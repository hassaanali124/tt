00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.417
<v Instructor>So let's now continue building</v>

2
00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:05.084
our animated button.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.873
So this is the final page and the final button.

4
00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:10.931
And what we're missing here is this white part

5
00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:14.072
that looks like it zooms out to infinity when we hover,

6
00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:16.136
and it comes back when we hover out.

7
00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:16.969
See.

8
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:18.786
So this nice effect.

9
00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:21.549
It's not really necessary, of course, to add this.

10
00:00:21.549 --> 00:00:24.455
But it was a great opportunity to show you the power

11
00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:27.563
of CSS and of pseudo-elements.

12
00:00:27.563 --> 00:00:30.230
So let me show you how we do it.

13
00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:33.832
So as I said, we're gonna use pseudo-elements.

14
00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:35.377
And pseudo-elements allow us

15
00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:38.440
to style certain parts of elements.

16
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.688
For example, the after pseudo-element that we're

17
00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:43.463
gonna use adds like a virtual element

18
00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:46.067
right after the element that we're selecting.

19
00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.253
And we can then style that element.

20
00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:50.260
And so using this after pseudo-element

21
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.148
can be really powerful to do some cool effects.

22
00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:55.426
And once you master it,

23
00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:58.103
you're gonna want to use it all the time.

24
00:00:58.103 --> 00:00:59.686
So, let me just add

25
00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:03.669
the after pseudo-element.

26
00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:05.745
So the trick here is to add an element

27
00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:08.441
that looks exactly like the button that we already have,

28
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.724
but we put it behind the button.

29
00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:12.579
And when we hover out of the button,

30
00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.306
then this hidden pseudo-element

31
00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:18.174
amazingly goes back behind the button.

32
00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:20.565
So let's see how we can do this.

33
00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:23.119
First, in order for an after pseudo-element

34
00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.272
to actually appear on the page,

35
00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:28.072
we need to specify its content property.

36
00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:29.888
So that's always necessary.

37
00:01:29.888 --> 00:01:31.250
It doesn't matter what the content is.

38
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.654
It can even be empty like we're gonna do here,

39
00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:34.985
but we have to specify it.

40
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.115
Otherwise it's not going to appear.

41
00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.535
And the same thing with the display property.

42
00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:42.108
So we have to specify the display property.

43
00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:44.507
And in this case, we're gonna say it's an inline block

44
00:01:44.507 --> 00:01:49.019
because the button that we have is also an inline block.

45
00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:51.593
And so, again, we want it to be exactly the same.

46
00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:53.299
We want it to look the same.

47
00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.193
So we want to have a height of 100%.

48
00:01:57.193 --> 00:02:01.276
And we want to have a width of 100% as well.

49
00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.873
And this works because the after pseudo-element

50
00:02:04.873 --> 00:02:08.233
is basically treated like a child of the button.

51
00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.242
And so if we say that we want the height to be 100%,

52
00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:14.559
that's 100% of the width of the button.

53
00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:18.720
And so suppose that the button has 100 pixels

54
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.829
of height and 50 pixels of width.

55
00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.421
And so this after pseudo-element

56
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:26.587
will have the exact same dimensions if we set it to 100%.

57
00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:30.936
Now the border rate is, should also be the same.

58
00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:31.877
100 pixels.

59
00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:33.858
So something really big.

60
00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:36.321
And now, we also want it to be white.

61
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:37.770
But in order for it to be white,

62
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.890
we actually should make another after pseudo-element

63
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.039
but this time for the button, right.

64
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.789
So let's put it here.

65
00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:48.117
And after.

66
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.495
And so background color

67
00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:53.828
should be white.

68
00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:56.528
Alright.

69
00:02:56.528 --> 00:03:00.695
Now let's just see on our page if it actually shows up.

70
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:06.669
So right now it still looks like it's part of our element.

71
00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.196
And so we should change that.

72
00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:10.235
So what we wanna do,

73
00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:11.154
remember,

74
00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:14.419
is to put it behind our actual button.

75
00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:15.993
So how can we do that?

76
00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:18.653
And we use absolute positioning.

77
00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:20.736
So position and absolute.

78
00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:24.951
And then we just say it should be zero from the top

79
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:26.868
and zero from the left.

80
00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:30.837
Now remember that this absolute positioning

81
00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:32.642
needs to have a reference.

82
00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:34.763
And the reference is the first element

83
00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:37.349
with the relative position that it can find.

84
00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.096
Now in this case it would be the header

85
00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:41.216
because remember we did that before.

86
00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:42.514
But we don't want it to be the header.

87
00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:45.078
We want it to be hidden after the button.

88
00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:47.053
And so, the reference should be the button.

89
00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:48.986
Therefore, what we have to do

90
00:03:48.986 --> 00:03:53.153
is to set the position property of the button to relative.

91
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.627
Alright.

92
00:03:55.627 --> 00:03:59.122
And so now it should be hidden behind the button.

93
00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:00.925
Now one more thing that we have to do

94
00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:02.528
is to set the z index.

95
00:04:02.528 --> 00:04:04.391
And we will put it to minus one.

96
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.165
So remember the z index defines the position

97
00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:10.546
of the elements if they are one on top of another.

98
00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:11.851
And so this one has minus one

99
00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:14.080
and so it's definitely behind the button.

100
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.913
Now since it's hidden,

101
00:04:14.913 --> 00:04:17.188
I cannot really show it to you on the page now.

102
00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:20.068
But we're gonna see it in a little bit.

103
00:04:20.068 --> 00:04:22.372
So when do we actually want to see it.

104
00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:24.743
We want to see it when we hover the button.

105
00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:28.737
So what we're gonna do is to write it like this.

106
00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:30.560
And this may seem a bit complicated,

107
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.982
but it's actually not.

108
00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:34.836
So, when we hover the button,

109
00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:37.012
then we want some certain styles

110
00:04:37.012 --> 00:04:39.429
for the after pseudo-element.

111
00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:44.087
So this looks a bit weird but it makes total sense.

112
00:04:44.087 --> 00:04:46.573
So this is an after pseudo-element

113
00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:50.413
only when we have the button on the hover state.

114
00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:53.267
And what do we want to happen?

115
00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:54.398
We want it to be bigger.

116
00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:55.964
Right. Remember.

117
00:04:55.964 --> 00:04:58.487
We want the element to grow and to fade out.

118
00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:03.056
And so, what we first do is to use once again,

119
00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.133
the transform property.

120
00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:06.955
And I told you it was really important and,

121
00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:08.288
so yeah, it is.

122
00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:09.864
This time we do a scale.

123
00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:11.572
So what scale does is to simply

124
00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:13.410
increase the element.

125
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.114
So if we do scale two,

126
00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:18.851
then it will appear double the size that it had before.

127
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:23.293
So now we can actually check if it's working alright.

128
00:05:23.293 --> 00:05:24.311
So reload.

129
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.309
And, whoa.

130
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:26.164
There it is.

131
00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:27.874
So this white part that you see

132
00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:30.705
outside here is the pseudo-element

133
00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.800
that becomes visible as soon as we hover over the button.

134
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.240
Let's actually make it a different color here,

135
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.073
like red,

136
00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:42.637
just so that you can see the difference.

137
00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:43.470
And whoa.

138
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.498
Now it's everything red.

139
00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:47.163
But that's not a problem.

140
00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:49.837
For some reason the original button is also getting red.

141
00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:52.660
But we still can be sure the pseudo-element is behind

142
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.041
the button because we still can see the text.

143
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:57.826
And so that means that the original button

144
00:05:57.826 --> 00:06:00.993
is still on top of the pseudo-element.

145
00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:05.792
Let's put it back to white, where it was.

146
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.333
And we don't want to scale it this much.

147
00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:13.083
So let's just say one point five.

148
00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.149
And we also want this to be animated just like before.

149
00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:19.908
So where do we have to put the transition property?

150
00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:20.741
Exactly.

151
00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:22.392
We do it on the initial state.

152
00:06:22.392 --> 00:06:25.062
In this case the initial state is of course

153
00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:27.904
this after pseudo-element.

154
00:06:27.904 --> 00:06:28.737
So we say

155
00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:31.574
transition,

156
00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:35.045
and again I'm going to use all here,

157
00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:39.212
and then use, let's say, point four seconds in this case.

158
00:06:41.545 --> 00:06:43.168
So here we had point two,

159
00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:47.574
but we want this one to take a little bit longer.

160
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:48.783
Now what also happens,

161
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.522
is that the element actually fades out.

162
00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:52.911
So opacity zero.

163
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.043
That's the trick for fading something out,

164
00:06:55.043 --> 00:06:57.241
is going to opacity zero.

165
00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:58.930
We did that before in our other animation

166
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.351
in the lecture before,

167
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:02.558
and so here we're doing it again.

168
00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:06.150
So opacity zero sets something to invisible basically.

169
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.342
So let's check out

170
00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:09.009
if it works already.

171
00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:11.248
Yeah, that's actually it.

172
00:07:11.248 --> 00:07:13.231
It's already working, right?

173
00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:14.388
It comes back.

174
00:07:14.388 --> 00:07:16.297
It goes out and it comes back.

175
00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:18.139
So, really cool, right?

176
00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.173
Now we can make this a a little bit better

177
00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:23.247
because if you look closely at the top of the button,

178
00:07:23.247 --> 00:07:25.138
and you see that it looks really small.

179
00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:27.529
So the part that's fading out is like really small.

180
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:28.587
Take a look.

181
00:07:28.587 --> 00:07:30.850
So let's do this a bit better.

182
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.099
And actually with this I can show you

183
00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:33.568
that there are different scales.

184
00:07:33.568 --> 00:07:36.639
So scale, without any epsilon here,

185
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.493
simply scales the entire element.

186
00:07:38.493 --> 00:07:40.806
But we can do scale x,

187
00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:43.925
and then that's how it's gonna scale on the x direction.

188
00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:45.567
On the x axis.

189
00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:48.898
And here we want to do one point four.

190
00:07:48.898 --> 00:07:52.407
And now scale, epsilon as you can imagine,

191
00:07:52.407 --> 00:07:53.405
in the other direction.

192
00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:56.549
So let's put one point six here.

193
00:07:56.549 --> 00:07:57.989
So they are different scales.

194
00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:00.322
Just like they are different translates,

195
00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:03.299
or rotates, or other functions that we can put

196
00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:04.943
here in the transform.

197
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.860
So, let's check it out.

198
00:08:08.742 --> 00:08:09.575
And, yeah.

199
00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:11.992
So now it looks a bit better.

200
00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.360
So, really cool.

201
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.203
There's just one thing left here because,

202
00:08:16.203 --> 00:08:20.370
take a look here what happens when we load the page.

203
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.402
You saw this.

204
00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:24.477
This came up moving from the bottom.

205
00:08:24.477 --> 00:08:26.926
So first, we saw these two elements coming in,

206
00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:28.702
like we coded before.

207
00:08:28.702 --> 00:08:30.286
And then the button came up

208
00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:32.671
from the bottom to this position.

209
00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:34.369
So let's very quickly code up

210
00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:36.079
another animation for that.

211
00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:38.963
And we're gonna put it here after this one.

212
00:08:38.963 --> 00:08:40.907
Actually I'm gonna copy it

213
00:08:40.907 --> 00:08:43.157
'cause it's pretty similar.

214
00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:45.562
So move in,

215
00:08:46.964 --> 00:08:49.032
let's say bottom now,

216
00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:50.070
from the bottom.

217
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.789
This time we don't need any 80%

218
00:08:51.789 --> 00:08:54.303
because it's just from one point to the other.

219
00:08:54.303 --> 00:08:56.926
And now I'm going to leave it to you to specify,

220
00:08:56.926 --> 00:08:58.019
let's see,

221
00:08:58.019 --> 00:08:59.661
what we should put here.

222
00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:00.536
So pause the video,

223
00:09:00.536 --> 00:09:04.536
and try to figure out how this should look like.

224
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:07.463
So, did you figure it out?

225
00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:10.355
How should the button be positioned

226
00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:13.368
right in the beginning before the animation starts?

227
00:09:13.368 --> 00:09:16.247
It should be a bit lower than its current position, right?

228
00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:17.947
Because it's moving in from the bottom

229
00:09:17.947 --> 00:09:20.155
to its original position.

230
00:09:20.155 --> 00:09:24.693
And so we can do translate epsilon this time.

231
00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:27.900
And put something like 30 pixels in here.

232
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.308
That's because remember,

233
00:09:29.308 --> 00:09:31.321
for the epsilon direction

234
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.425
it goes like this.

235
00:09:32.425 --> 00:09:33.660
So from top to bottom.

236
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.108
So if we want to move it down, it's a positive value.

237
00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:37.941
Alright.

238
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:40.364
And let's now actually use this animation.

239
00:09:40.364 --> 00:09:44.114
Now again there will be multiple buttons like this.

240
00:09:44.114 --> 00:09:45.798
But I only want this animation to happen

241
00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:47.615
on this particular button.

242
00:09:47.615 --> 00:09:48.486
And so what I'm gonna do

243
00:09:48.486 --> 00:09:51.736
is to create a new class on the button.

244
00:09:53.997 --> 00:09:54.830
So button,

245
00:09:55.832 --> 00:09:56.988
animated.

246
00:09:56.988 --> 00:09:58.930
And only this button will have this class.

247
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.175
Okay?

248
00:10:00.175 --> 00:10:01.961
So let's put it here.

249
00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:02.794
Button.

250
00:10:03.996 --> 00:10:05.091
Animated.

251
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:07.808
And then in here I will put the animation.

252
00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:08.915
So animation,

253
00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:10.734
and I'm going to use the shorten property

254
00:10:10.734 --> 00:10:12.348
that I showed you before.

255
00:10:12.348 --> 00:10:15.265
And now it's called move in bottom.

256
00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:20.518
And let's use point five, second animation.

257
00:10:20.518 --> 00:10:24.166
And we're gonna use an ease out this time.

258
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:25.157
Okay?

259
00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:28.245
Now plus what we're gonna do is to have a delay.

260
00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:30.886
So we don't want to start it at the same time as the others.

261
00:10:30.886 --> 00:10:33.016
We want it to start slightly later.

262
00:10:33.016 --> 00:10:34.563
So maybe not one entire second,

263
00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:37.471
which is the animation time of the other two animations,

264
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:40.217
but maybe just 75% of that.

265
00:10:40.217 --> 00:10:41.467
So .75 seconds.

266
00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:45.203
So I told you that we could put all of

267
00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:47.497
these values in the same animation property.

268
00:10:47.497 --> 00:10:50.109
So this is the animation name, the animation duration,

269
00:10:50.109 --> 00:10:51.952
the animation timing function,

270
00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:54.264
and the animation delay.

271
00:10:54.264 --> 00:10:57.764
So let's take a look at what happens here.

272
00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:03.288
Alright, so you saw that.

273
00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.181
Actually the button was visible

274
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:07.286
before the animation happened.

275
00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:09.134
Let's take a look again.

276
00:11:09.134 --> 00:11:12.083
So it stays visible and then it starts.

277
00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:15.029
Now what could we do in order to prevent this.

278
00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:18.955
We could simply put these initial states on the button.

279
00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:21.222
But that would be highly impractical, right?

280
00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.873
Wouldn't make much sense.

281
00:11:22.873 --> 00:11:26.433
So there is another property related to animations.

282
00:11:26.433 --> 00:11:30.034
And this one is called animation fill mode

283
00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:31.951
So animation fill mode.

284
00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:35.879
And now we can set it to backwards.

285
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.511
And what this does,

286
00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:40.373
is that it will automatically apply

287
00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:45.044
the styles up to zero percent before the animation starts.

288
00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:48.438
So, again, these styles will now be applied

289
00:11:48.438 --> 00:11:50.731
before the animation starts simply by using the

290
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:54.942
animation fill mode and set it to backwards.

291
00:11:54.942 --> 00:11:56.128
So, pretty amazing right?

292
00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:59.280
So it's really simple, simple solution to this problem.

293
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.487
And so let's try it again.

294
00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:03.928
And, yeah, so here it works.

295
00:12:03.928 --> 00:12:04.761
Alright.

296
00:12:04.761 --> 00:12:05.978
And that's it for this lecture,

297
00:12:05.978 --> 00:12:08.213
and actually for this section.

298
00:12:08.213 --> 00:12:10.089
So, we've come a long way so far,

299
00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:13.205
and we already coded a bunch of really cool stuff I think.

300
00:12:13.205 --> 00:12:16.184
We already have the header already completed.

301
00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:17.805
Only what's missing here is this navigation

302
00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:19.272
but it's a bit too complex for now,

303
00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:22.384
so we're gonna leave it for another time.

304
00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:24.937
But for now, we've come far enough with this project

305
00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:27.347
that it's now time to show you a little bit of

306
00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:29.872
how CSS actually works behind the scenes.

307
00:12:29.872 --> 00:12:31.695
So I have a couple of really great lectures

308
00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:34.671
coming up which I spent a lot of time building for you.

309
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.054
But they will be really insightful and helpful,

310
00:12:37.054 --> 00:12:37.965
I hope.

311
00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:38.798
So,

312
00:12:38.798 --> 00:12:41.144
review what we just did in this section maybe.

313
00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:44.549
Or you can just move on to the next one right now.

314
00:12:44.549 --> 00:12:46.716
Anyway, see you next time.
