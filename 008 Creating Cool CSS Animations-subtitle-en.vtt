00:00:01.357 --> 00:00:03.884
<v Jonas>It's now time for a very cool lecture</v>

2
00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:05.800
and one that I'm really excited about

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.169
because we're gonna talk about

4
00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.836
how to implement CSS animations.

5
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:13.605
So, as I said, you're gonna learn in this lecture

6
00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.463
how to create CSS animations using the keyframes at-rule

7
00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:20.489
and the animation property.

8
00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.109
So what we're trying to do

9
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.102
is this animation that we're gonna see here.

10
00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:28.153
So watch carefully at these two parts here,

11
00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.320
or H1 element.

12
00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.935
So this one fades in,

13
00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.423
and it also moves in from the right side here.

14
00:00:36.423 --> 00:00:37.256
Right?

15
00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.715
And this one moves in from the left side

16
00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:40.201
and it also fades in.

17
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.478
So let's take a look again.

18
00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:43.852
So, that's it.

19
00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.167
This one fades from the left,

20
00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:47.588
and this one fades in from the right.

21
00:00:47.588 --> 00:00:50.366
So let's code these animations in CSS.

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.177
And it's really cool, believe me.

23
00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.877
Now there are generally two types of animations in CSS.

24
00:00:55.877 --> 00:00:58.489
The first one, which is also the easier one,

25
00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.821
is to just use the transition property,

26
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:02.257
and then change the properties

27
00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:04.216
that you want to animate on an event,

28
00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:06.286
like when we hover the element.

29
00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:08.625
And I'm sure that you're familiar with this method,

30
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:09.708
and if not, don't worry

31
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:12.326
because we're gonna use in the next lecture.

32
00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:14.466
But what we're doing in this lecture is a bit different

33
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.097
and actually a bit more advanced and cooler.

34
00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:20.383
Because these animations allow us to put more options

35
00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:22.285
and so they are a bit more complex.

36
00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:24.073
So let me show you how it works.

37
00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:25.874
So we start by creating an animation

38
00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:28.512
that looks exactly like we want it to be.

39
00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:31.567
And in order to do that, we use the keyframes at-rule.

40
00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.484
So we write @keyframes,

41
00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.621
@keyframes, and then we give the animation a name.

42
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:40.131
And we're gonna start with the first part

43
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:42.099
so, the heading primary main.

44
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.276
Which remember, moves in from the left.

45
00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:47.943
So I'm gonna call this animation moveInLeft.

46
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.537
Okay.

47
00:01:50.537 --> 00:01:53.137
And now in here, I can specify what I want to happen

48
00:01:53.137 --> 00:01:55.657
in each moment of time of the animation.

49
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.321
So we start with 0% which is before

50
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.304
the animation actually starts.

51
00:02:00.304 --> 00:02:02.767
So this can also be called start.

52
00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.287
Then the finish is at 100%,

53
00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:08.583
which is when the animation finishes.

54
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:11.206
But we can put other steps here in the middle.

55
00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:13.534
So for example, if we want something to happen

56
00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:17.701
at the moment where the animation is at 80%, for example,

57
00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.768
and we could do 50, we could do 36,

58
00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:24.470
we could do any percentage here that we want.

59
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.204
But let's just start with 0%, so the initial state,

60
00:02:28.204 --> 00:02:31.832
and then 100%, which is the final state.

61
00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:34.229
So how do we want the element to look like

62
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.558
before it starts to move in?

63
00:02:36.558 --> 00:02:38.648
First, we want it to be invisible.

64
00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:39.481
Right?

65
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.408
So what we can do is opacity zero.

66
00:02:42.408 --> 00:02:44.394
So at the beginning of our animation,

67
00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:46.845
the opacity will be zero and at the end of course,

68
00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:49.330
we want it to be back to one.

69
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.379
So opacity, one.

70
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.844
So that's one of the properties that we're animating here.

71
00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:56.498
Now for the browser performance,

72
00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:59.515
it's best to only ever animate two different properties.

73
00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.281
One is opacity, which is the one that we're using here,

74
00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.113
and the other one is the transform property.

75
00:03:05.113 --> 00:03:06.875
That's what the browsers are optimized for,

76
00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:08.907
for these two properties.

77
00:03:08.907 --> 00:03:11.359
But with transform, we can do a whole lot.

78
00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.648
And so it's everything that we need actually

79
00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:16.146
to make all these cool animations that you can imagine.

80
00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:19.150
So remember that the element comes in from the left.

81
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.101
So where do we want it to be in the beginning,

82
00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.528
before the animation actually starts?

83
00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:25.925
We want it to be more on the left than in the beginning.

84
00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:26.787
Right?

85
00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:28.936
And so we can use

86
00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:29.769
transform

87
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.878
and then translateX.

88
00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:34.653
And why x?

89
00:03:34.653 --> 00:03:38.558
Well, because we want it to animate in the x-direction.

90
00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:41.299
So remember, the x-direction is like this,

91
00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.617
go from left to right,

92
00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.856
and the y-direction, or axis,

93
00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:47.523
goes from the top to the bottom.

94
00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:51.189
So we want to translate it in the x-direction,

95
00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.762
and we want it to be more on the left than in the beginning.

96
00:03:53.762 --> 00:03:55.476
And so it's a negative value.

97
00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:57.976
So let's say 100 pixels minus.

98
00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:00.094
Okay?

99
00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:02.096
Because, remember that the direction goes

100
00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:03.490
from left to right.

101
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.326
So a positive value means it goes to the right,

102
00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:09.171
and negative value means it goes to the left.

103
00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:12.331
So just like in basic mathematics.

104
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:13.975
Alright, but moving back here.

105
00:04:13.975 --> 00:04:18.058
How do we want it to be when we are at 100%?

106
00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:22.402
We simply want it to look the way that it looks now, right?

107
00:04:22.402 --> 00:04:24.319
And so we say translate

108
00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:28.190
zero.

109
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.282
And why zero?

110
00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:31.341
Well because, if we translate at zero,

111
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:33.175
then it's gonna look exactly the way

112
00:04:33.175 --> 00:04:34.649
that it looks right now.

113
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.897
Make sense?

114
00:04:35.897 --> 00:04:39.104
So this is the very basic animation just with the initial

115
00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:40.446
and the final state.

116
00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.199
So let's now actually apply this animation.

117
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.768
And so for an animation to work,

118
00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:47.523
there are only two properties

119
00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:49.639
that we have to really specify.

120
00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.306
Which are called animation-name,

121
00:04:53.407 --> 00:04:55.905
so animation-name which is the name

122
00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:57.502
of the animation we just wrote.

123
00:04:57.502 --> 00:04:59.335
And so it's moveInLeft

124
00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:00.168
moveInLeft

125
00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:04.701
and then the animation duration.

126
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:05.534
Okay,

127
00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:07.117
animation-duration.

128
00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:11.256
And so this the time that the animation should take.

129
00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:15.341
Just to see it in the beginning, let's put three seconds

130
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:16.196
so it takes a longer time

131
00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:18.470
so we can see if it's actually working.

132
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.887
We can actually put five seconds

133
00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:21.888
and it takes even a bit longer.

134
00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.216
So these are the only properties that are required

135
00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:25.657
for an animation to work.

136
00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:27.040
Now, there are a lot more properties,

137
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.628
but I'm gonna show them to you in a second.

138
00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:32.136
Now let's just see if this actually works.

139
00:05:32.136 --> 00:05:35.303
And so we need to reload our page now.

140
00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:38.977
And yeah, you see? It's working. Great!

141
00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:40.623
Amazing, right?

142
00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:43.903
This is really fantastic, so let me play it again.

143
00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:46.189
So it's happening really slow because we

144
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.733
specified it for five seconds but we can then change that.

145
00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:53.602
Now let me play the original one again.

146
00:05:53.602 --> 00:05:55.818
And you see that in this version it actually first goes

147
00:05:55.818 --> 00:05:58.142
a bit in that direction and then it moves back, right?

148
00:05:58.142 --> 00:05:59.919
Let me play it again.

149
00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.373
So it's this, this small movement in this direction.

150
00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:06.197
So how do you think we are going to do that?

151
00:06:06.197 --> 00:06:07.478
What do you think?

152
00:06:07.478 --> 00:06:10.577
And that's right, we're going to use this 80% here.

153
00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:13.070
So what we can say here is that we want it to be

154
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.653
at this point, translateX to be

155
00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:18.739
20 pixels, for example.

156
00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:22.303
Because remember if we're specifying a positive value here

157
00:06:22.303 --> 00:06:24.362
it will go to the right side.

158
00:06:24.362 --> 00:06:26.364
So the final position is zero,

159
00:06:26.364 --> 00:06:29.775
the initial position is a lot more to the left,

160
00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:33.273
and then this intermediate position, let's say,

161
00:06:33.273 --> 00:06:35.566
is a bit more to the right.

162
00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.399
So let's check it out.

163
00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:43.241
And yeah, nice! That's really nice.

164
00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:47.019
Let's just put it a bit slower now that we have

165
00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.349
this animation really going on already.

166
00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:51.182
So just in one second.

167
00:06:53.236 --> 00:06:56.048
Alright. Maybe that's a bit too much.

168
00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.965
I will leave it just at ten pixels.

169
00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:02.706
Great. So this already works.

170
00:07:02.706 --> 00:07:05.092
Now I told you that there are other properties

171
00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.738
for animations that we can also specify as.

172
00:07:07.738 --> 00:07:09.649
So let's take a look at them.

173
00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.575
The first one is that we can set a delay.

174
00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:16.255
So animation-delay, let's say three seconds

175
00:07:16.255 --> 00:07:18.629
and so now before this animation starts to play,

176
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:20.270
it will first wait three seconds.

177
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.020
So let's take a look.

178
00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:27.290
Alright, so here we go.

179
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.207
So it waited three seconds. So one, two, three,

180
00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:33.467
and there it goes.

181
00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:36.449
Okay, so that's the animation delay.

182
00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:38.662
Now we can also do something else,

183
00:07:38.662 --> 00:07:41.071
I'm actually going to comment out

184
00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:44.092
this part that we don't want,

185
00:07:44.092 --> 00:07:45.953
because this is just to show you

186
00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:48.645
but I will not delete it so that you can still see it

187
00:07:48.645 --> 00:07:52.030
because it's properties can be very useful sometimes.

188
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.197
Okay. Another one that we can do is an animation count,

189
00:07:57.754 --> 00:07:59.921
animation-iteration-count.

190
00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.885
So if we set this to, let's say, three,

191
00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:07.114
then the animation will simply happen three times.

192
00:08:07.114 --> 00:08:09.064
So let's check that out as well.

193
00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:10.647
So one, two, three.

194
00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:13.961
Okay?

195
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:16.128
But we also don't want this one to happen

196
00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.393
so I'm putting it here in the commented code.

197
00:08:18.393 --> 00:08:21.301
And then one that is actually quite important

198
00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.551
which is the animation-timing-function.

199
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:27.767
So this is a function which defines

200
00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:29.791
how the animation will proceed.

201
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:32.545
So, how fast or how slow these parameters

202
00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:36.011
that we specified here happen over time.

203
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:38.685
And there are different built-in animation functions

204
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:43.004
for example, ease-out, so ease-out for example.

205
00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:45.187
Let's take a look at it now.

206
00:08:45.187 --> 00:08:47.213
Probably gonna look a bit similar,

207
00:08:47.213 --> 00:08:50.509
but they are different timing functions.

208
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:52.735
So I already have this one here open.

209
00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:55.098
So we have ease, ease-in, ease-out,

210
00:08:55.098 --> 00:08:59.451
and then all of these built-in animation timing functions.

211
00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:02.244
So for example with the ease-in function,

212
00:09:02.244 --> 00:09:04.013
the animation will start slower

213
00:09:04.013 --> 00:09:05.732
and then accelerate over time.

214
00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:07.769
And with ease-out, it's the opposite.

215
00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:09.592
So it will start faster

216
00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:13.326
and then it will become slower by the end.

217
00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:15.196
So this might sound a bit complicated

218
00:09:15.196 --> 00:09:17.436
but we're gonna look at animation timing functions

219
00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:19.574
again in another lecture.

220
00:09:19.574 --> 00:09:22.762
We're also going to look at this cubic-bezier function here

221
00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:25.960
which basically allows us to write a custom function.

222
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.074
So a custom timing function different from

223
00:09:29.074 --> 00:09:31.910
these predefined functions.

224
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.194
And this can actually make all the difference

225
00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:37.276
in how the animation feels to the user.

226
00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:39.859
So we used, remember, ease-out.

227
00:09:41.189 --> 00:09:43.106
So let's play it again.

228
00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:49.515
And this is how ease-in, for example, looks like.

229
00:09:51.085 --> 00:09:53.170
So it was slower towards the beginning,

230
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.230
and then faster at the end. See?

231
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.379
So at the end it happened a lot faster.

232
00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:01.204
So let's stick with ease-out like we had at the beginning.

233
00:10:01.204 --> 00:10:04.855
Okay, and these are the most essential animation properties.

234
00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:05.883
There are actually more,

235
00:10:05.883 --> 00:10:08.379
but they are not really so important.

236
00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:11.162
We can take a look at them if you're really interested.

237
00:10:11.162 --> 00:10:13.770
So this is the moveInLeft animation

238
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.954
but we can now also build the moveInRight.

239
00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:20.633
So let's just copy this part of the code

240
00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:22.633
and call it moveInRight.

241
00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:26.869
So, how do you think this one will look like?

242
00:10:26.869 --> 00:10:28.926 line:15% 
So I want you to pause the video now

243
00:10:28.926 --> 00:10:30.758 line:15% 
and try to change these values here

244
00:10:30.758 --> 00:10:33.908 line:15% 
so that the animation instead of going in from the left,

245
00:10:33.908 --> 00:10:35.291 line:15% 
it goes in from the right.

246
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:38.124 line:15% 
So take a second and try that out.

247
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.031
Alright, did you manage to do it?

248
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:42.873
Well let's see.

249
00:10:42.873 --> 00:10:45.486
What do you think is the most logical way of doing it?

250
00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:49.299
So all we have to do, is to actually remove this minus here,

251
00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:51.167
and put it here.

252
00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:52.149
And why is that?

253
00:10:52.149 --> 00:10:55.567
Because as I mentioned, this 100 pixels here,

254
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:59.254
if it's a plus value, it moves the element to the right.

255
00:10:59.254 --> 00:11:01.924
Because it goes forward in the x-direction.

256
00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:03.791
And so it's the opposite as we had before,

257
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:05.913
and then the same thing, of course, here.

258
00:11:05.913 --> 00:11:08.459
Because now we want it to move a little bit to the left,

259
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:12.507
before it goes back to it's original position at zero.

260
00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:13.340
Right?

261
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.549
Okay. So now all we have to do is to add it here.

262
00:11:18.549 --> 00:11:20.180
Now instead of specifying all of

263
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.096
these properties here one-by-one,

264
00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:25.412
animation-name, duration, timing-function, delay, et cetera,

265
00:11:25.412 --> 00:11:27.973
we can simply use the shortened property

266
00:11:27.973 --> 00:11:29.991
and just say animation.

267
00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:32.061
And so you can put all of these together,

268
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:35.930
and then CSS will figure out what means what.

269
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.869
So moveInRight over the duration of one second,

270
00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:42.452
and with the ease-out function.

271
00:11:43.796 --> 00:11:46.472
And that should work now.

272
00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:48.800
So let's take a look.

273
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.579
And, yep! So it's exactly what we had before.

274
00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.514
Great.

275
00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:56.498
Now maybe you have already noticing that here in the end,

276
00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:57.995
take a look here at this text,

277
00:11:57.995 --> 00:12:00.533
right before the animation ends you will probably

278
00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:03.317
see a little shake here, okay?

279
00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:05.501
So let's take a close look at the end.

280
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:06.334
There it was.

281
00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:08.176
So it moved a little bit like to the top.

282
00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:09.033
Did you see it?

283
00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:11.202
Let's take a look again.

284
00:12:11.202 --> 00:12:13.070
So you saw it moving? So it moved a little bit,

285
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.261
so it's a bit shaky,

286
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:17.277
and sometimes this happens in animations.

287
00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:18.110
And to be honest,

288
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.494
no one really knows actually why this happens,

289
00:12:21.494 --> 00:12:24.174
but we, actually, we have a fix for this.

290
00:12:24.174 --> 00:12:26.346
So there is something that we can do

291
00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:28.707
and what we have to do in this case,

292
00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:32.924
is to simply declare the backface-visibility property,

293
00:12:32.924 --> 00:12:36.348
backface-visibility, and set it to hidden.

294
00:12:36.348 --> 00:12:38.850
So the entire heading-primary element

295
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.127
because you see actually this entire element

296
00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:43.794
is what moves on this animation.

297
00:12:44.683 --> 00:12:45.516
So it's a bit shaky,

298
00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:48.260
and its the entire heading-primary element.

299
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.657
This backface-visibility property determines

300
00:12:50.657 --> 00:12:54.321
if the back part of the element when we transform it

301
00:12:54.321 --> 00:12:56.887
is visible or hidden for the user.

302
00:12:56.887 --> 00:13:00.748
So imagine we have an element and we rotate it 180 degrees.

303
00:13:00.748 --> 00:13:03.267
So it would be logical that we then see the back part

304
00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:04.616
of that element, right?

305
00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.878
But if we use backface-visibility hidden,

306
00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:08.150
then that back part,

307
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.950
so that part that's behind the element, let's say,

308
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.692
that part actually gets hidden.

309
00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:13.525
Now in this case,

310
00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:14.588
we're not rotating anything,

311
00:13:14.588 --> 00:13:16.587
we're not doing anything like that

312
00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:17.949
but we still use this fix here,

313
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:20.976
like this hack in order to fix this little shaking

314
00:13:20.976 --> 00:13:22.726
that we see in the animation.

315
00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:23.559
And again,

316
00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:26.545
no one really seems to know why the shaking happens

317
00:13:26.545 --> 00:13:31.040
and why this fixes it, but as long as it works, it's okay.

318
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.590
And so now, let's take a look at it again

319
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.757
and look really closely here, really close.

320
00:13:37.757 --> 00:13:40.153
And it's gone, right?

321
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.362
It's no longer shaking

322
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:44.768
and everything appears to be working just fine.

323
00:13:44.768 --> 00:13:47.064
And so yeah, that's how animations work.

324
00:13:47.064 --> 00:13:49.588
So this is a really powerful thing.

325
00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:51.813
And we could actually go really crazy with this.

326
00:13:51.813 --> 00:13:55.980
Imagine we would do something like put a 60% here

327
00:13:58.772 --> 00:14:02.855
and say transform at this point should be rotate,

328
00:14:03.916 --> 00:14:07.155
let's say, just something like 120 degrees.

329
00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:10.620
So degree is a unit we use for rotations.

330
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.953
And we can also say that in the beginning it should be

331
00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:14.786
rotate

332
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.740
minus 50 degrees.

333
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.546
So just some random numbers here to try out

334
00:14:20.546 --> 00:14:22.594
to see what happens. Okay?

335
00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:25.440
Not really sure how it's gonna look like.

336
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.028
So it's this crazy thing, you see?

337
00:14:28.028 --> 00:14:29.207
Let me play it again to you.

338
00:14:29.207 --> 00:14:31.584
So this is just something crazy just to show you

339
00:14:31.584 --> 00:14:34.981
the power that we have here with these animations.

340
00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:37.535
To make it a bit more realistic,

341
00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:40.452
let's say we rotate it 360 degrees.

342
00:14:47.044 --> 00:14:51.211
Well that didn't really work, but let's try 180 degrees.

343
00:14:52.932 --> 00:14:54.481
Now it should do something.

344
00:14:54.481 --> 00:14:56.056
Yeah.

345
00:14:56.056 --> 00:15:00.300
So it starts just right, and it rotates until 70% I believe,

346
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.109
or was it, oh yeah 60%

347
00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:05.853
and then it went back to the initial position

348
00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:07.701
because we didn't specify anything here.

349
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:11.368
We could actually put this one here as well.

350
00:15:13.381 --> 00:15:15.890
So we're just playing around here with the numbers,

351
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.017
you don't really have to follow this.

352
00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:21.222
I just wanted to show you that there's not really a limit.

353
00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:24.690
So this actually looks the same,

354
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.523
let me try it again.

355
00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:26.690
180 this time,

356
00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:29.907
and,

357
00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:32.818
well I guess it didn't work exactly

358
00:15:32.818 --> 00:15:36.475
because we have to put it here in this step as well.

359
00:15:36.475 --> 00:15:40.642
So let's put here as well just to play around a little bit.

360
00:15:42.123 --> 00:15:44.972
And here we go. Let me close this one,

361
00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:49.139
and of course, delete this little thing that we did here.

362
00:15:52.188 --> 00:15:55.771
Because this is just like we want it to be.

363
00:15:56.709 --> 00:15:58.350
You saw I selected two things at the same time.

364
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.399
You saw that?

365
00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:01.820
I'm sure you can do that as well in your code editor

366
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.376
and sometimes it's really handy.

367
00:16:03.376 --> 00:16:05.634
So for example, I have this transform.

368
00:16:05.634 --> 00:16:09.088
If I wanna select the next one, I just have to hit Command+D

369
00:16:09.088 --> 00:16:11.171
here in this Visual Studio code

370
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:14.628
but the same thing works in Atom or Brackets, or whatever.

371
00:16:14.628 --> 00:16:17.447
So if I just hit Command+D, and D, and D,

372
00:16:17.447 --> 00:16:19.101
then I have all of these transforms selected

373
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:21.029
and you see that the cursor is blinking here

374
00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:22.270
and so then I can delete,

375
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.571
and I can write something else if I want,

376
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:28.708
and it's happening in all these places at the same time.

377
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:30.321
Alright?

378
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:31.680
So this is not really CSS,

379
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.897
but it's a nice trick that you can use in your text editor.

380
00:16:34.897 --> 00:16:38.699
Also, I can put multiple cursors just by clicking it

381
00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:42.082
then hitting Command, or Control maybe on Windows

382
00:16:42.082 --> 00:16:45.228
and then just keep clicking and it will add multiple cursors

383
00:16:45.228 --> 00:16:46.710
all over the place.

384
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.293
You see, like this.

385
00:16:49.456 --> 00:16:51.779
And now if I start writing A-B-C,

386
00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:53.536
it's writing A-B-C everywhere.

387
00:16:53.536 --> 00:16:57.634
So in this case, not really useful but you can do it.

388
00:16:57.634 --> 00:16:59.653
And sometimes it's pretty useful

389
00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:03.413
like to change multiple things at the same time, okay?

390
00:17:03.413 --> 00:17:05.504
And since we're talking about text editors,

391
00:17:05.504 --> 00:17:09.015
I'm sure that yours also has this functionality here

392
00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:10.577
which is called Minimap,

393
00:17:10.577 --> 00:17:13.591
which shows us a very small version of our code.

394
00:17:13.591 --> 00:17:16.482
So we can use this to drive around in our code,

395
00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:17.945
or to move around.

396
00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:19.700
So imagine we wanna go to the beginning

397
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.776
and then we just need to click here,

398
00:17:20.776 --> 00:17:23.750
and then it goes exactly wherever you want to.

399
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.998
Or, imagine that I'm working here

400
00:17:24.998 --> 00:17:26.258
and I want to go to the animations

401
00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:28.789
and here I can see that these here look like the animations

402
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:30.700
and I just have to click here

403
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.327
and then I'm here at the place where I wrote the animations.

404
00:17:34.327 --> 00:17:36.888
So instead of scrolling all the way up and down,

405
00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:39.423
imagine we have 500 lines of CSS

406
00:17:39.423 --> 00:17:41.200
then this becomes really useful.

407
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.025
And so once again, this is also in your code editor,

408
00:17:44.025 --> 00:17:45.112
you just have to turn it on

409
00:17:45.112 --> 00:17:48.018
if it's not turned on by default.

410
00:17:48.018 --> 00:17:50.044
Only if you like it, of course.

411
00:17:50.044 --> 00:17:52.078
But I think it's pretty helpful sometimes.

412
00:17:52.078 --> 00:17:54.555
Okay, and that was the goal that I had for this lecture.

413
00:17:54.555 --> 00:17:56.972
So I showed you how animations work

414
00:17:56.972 --> 00:17:58.220
with the keyframes at-rule,

415
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.011
and I showed you that we can build

416
00:18:00.011 --> 00:18:02.835
really complex animations with this.

417
00:18:02.835 --> 00:18:04.139
Oh, but before we stop,

418
00:18:04.139 --> 00:18:05.979
I can actually show you something else

419
00:18:05.979 --> 00:18:08.762
which is, imagine that we don't just want this to happen

420
00:18:08.762 --> 00:18:10.033
when we reload the page.

421
00:18:10.033 --> 00:18:13.400
So imagine we want this to happen, this animation to happen

422
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.572
when we hover, for example, something.

423
00:18:15.572 --> 00:18:20.521
So let's say we want this animation to happen to the logo

424
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:21.690
when I hover it.

425
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.190
So let's say, logo

426
00:18:24.448 --> 00:18:25.281
hover,

427
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.881
and so you see I can actually use this animation here

428
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:30.922
in multiple places.

429
00:18:30.922 --> 00:18:33.828
So I can just define moveInRight in one place

430
00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:37.160
and then use it all over the place. Okay?

431
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.327
And so now this will only happen as soon as they hover.

432
00:18:42.964 --> 00:18:45.426
So let's reload this

433
00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:46.676
and here we go.

434
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.784
You see? There it is again.

435
00:18:50.784 --> 00:18:53.809
So, this animation does not only have to happen

436
00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:56.496
with the page load like we have these ones here,

437
00:18:56.496 --> 00:19:00.663
see these ones are on page load, but this one is on hover.

438
00:19:02.415 --> 00:19:04.373
Okay well this was just to show you,

439
00:19:04.373 --> 00:19:07.547
we don't really want it to be here, right?

440
00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:09.470
Okay, but this was now really all I had

441
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.078
to show you for this lecture.

442
00:19:11.078 --> 00:19:15.245
So let's now move on to the next video. See you there.
