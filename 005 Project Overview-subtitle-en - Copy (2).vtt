00:00:01.442 --> 00:00:03.898
<v Narrator>In this lecture, I just wanna quickly show you</v>

2
00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:05.495
the project that we're gonna build

3
00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:07.352
over the next couple of sections, and also show you

4
00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:11.102
the starter files and assets for the project.

5
00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:16.350
So, and here it is, this is the project we're gonna build,

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.103
and it's called Natours.

7
00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:20.656
And it's a website, unlike a landing page,

8
00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:24.261
for a fictional company that offers tours in the nature,

9
00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:25.261
so Na-tours.

10
00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:27.780
And I designed and built this project

11
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.722
exclusively just for this course.

12
00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:33.491
So let's take a look at the webpage.

13
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.808
So it has all this modern eloquent feel

14
00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:37.096
that you can see here.

15
00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:40.263
It has these nice animations, alright?

16
00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.176
So here we have like some features of the company,

17
00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:46.071
so for these tours that they offer,

18
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:49.162
and here you also have these nice animations.

19
00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:52.765
And down here, and this is I think the coolest part,

20
00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:54.851
so we have this animated card, so you see,

21
00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:58.227
when you hover these cards, then they turn like this,

22
00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:01.370
then you have this nice button here that you can click.

23
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.394
So a really cool effect, and you're gonna learn all of this

24
00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:07.320
with the most modern CSS techniques.

25
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.921
And what's also really cool is

26
00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:11.889
as soon as you hit this button here, you see what happens?

27
00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:15.964
It opens like this pop-up, and again this is pure CSS,

28
00:01:15.964 --> 00:01:19.128
no JavaScript needed for all of this.

29
00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:20.310
And we can nicely close it,

30
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.553
and then it has this effect where it fades out.

31
00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:26.627
And then down here we have the next section,

32
00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:28.660
which is like for reviews.

33
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.299
And you see that it actually has this video here

34
00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.430
going on in the background.

35
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.866
So people in my HTML and CSS course,

36
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.491
they were asking me all the time,

37
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:40.583
how do I do a background video?

38
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:43.287
And so now in this course, it's finally here.

39
00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:46.934
So we have a whole section with these cool effects

40
00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:51.923
here again, and also this nice background video going on.

41
00:01:51.923 --> 00:01:54.556
And then finally in the end, we have this forum,

42
00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:58.172
which also has this nice, modern look and feel,

43
00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:59.629
and it does some great features

44
00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.108
that I will show you as well.

45
00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:05.009
So for example, when you start filling out this field,

46
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.794
then the full name text here, it just slides down you see?

47
00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:09.677
You saw that?

48
00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:11.048
So the full name went down,

49
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:13.729
and now when I delete it, it goes back.

50
00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.480
So it's really cool. Once again, this is CSS only.

51
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.500
Then there's radio buttons here,

52
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.791
not these default radio buttons that you see everywhere.

53
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:25.008
These are custom-made designed radio buttons

54
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.017
just for this project.

55
00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:30.302
And then at the end, it's just a simple footer here.

56
00:02:30.302 --> 00:02:33.621
So this is the webpage that we're gonna build.

57
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.931
And I spent a lot of time designing this

58
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:39.629
to make it a really exciting project for you.

59
00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.578
And I believe it's a real cool project

60
00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:46.165
in order to learn and use tons of these new features

61
00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:49.527
for CSS that I have for you in this course.

62
00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:53.029
Oh, and I almost forgot the navigation here.

63
00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.125
So of course a website also has a navigation,

64
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.912
maybe you saw that it stays here all the time

65
00:02:56.912 --> 00:02:58.045
when we scroll.

66
00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.187
Okay? So this is a fixed position.

67
00:03:00.187 --> 00:03:03.548
And as soon as we hit it, it has this nice animation

68
00:03:03.548 --> 00:03:05.823
and then when we hover the items,

69
00:03:05.823 --> 00:03:08.308
it actually has this animation effect as well.

70
00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:11.035
So you see there's lots of animation effects going on,

71
00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:14.320
a lot of cool design elements, and yeah,

72
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.236
that's what I wanted to do with this project.

73
00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:19.471
Of course, if we hit this button again,

74
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:21.890
then it closes the navigation,

75
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.958
and you also see this nice effect going on

76
00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.334
with the opening and closing.

77
00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:26.646
So we're gonna do all of that

78
00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:28.583
over the next couple of sections.

79
00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.837
Now, about the starter files,

80
00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:32.782
I hope that you already downloaded them.

81
00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:35.324
But if you didn't, then just follow the instructions

82
00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:38.035
that I gave you in the first section of the course.

83
00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:40.587
So anyway, I already have the starter files here

84
00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:44.252
on my desktop as usual, so it's this folder.

85
00:03:44.252 --> 00:03:47.103
It has just a simple HTML file in there,

86
00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:48.756
and all images.

87
00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:51.671
So the images that we're gonna use for the page,

88
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:53.840
and also the background video of course

89
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.441
that I showed you before, and all these background images,

90
00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:02.316
and logos and the hero image for the first section,

91
00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:06.233
and then just a small starter CSS file as well.

92
00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.414
So let me just quickly fire up my text editor here,

93
00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:14.581
which is in my case, as I mentioned, Visual Code Studio.

94
00:04:15.448 --> 00:04:18.209
So again, you can use any editor that you want,

95
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.475
no matter if it's Atom, Brackets, Sublime

96
00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:23.773
or whatever you're using, you can continue using that.

97
00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:26.210
The editor that you choose is not important

98
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.764
for the final result, okay?

99
00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:32.787
So what I want you to do now is just open the project folder

100
00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:36.954
like this so that we can take a look at our files.

101
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.049
So, closing the welcome screen.

102
00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:43.416
And so that's our HTML file.

103
00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.784
It's just a simple barebone structure

104
00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:49.168
where we can start adding stuff to our body.

105
00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:52.200
So you see I already included the style CSS here.

106
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.585
I already gave it a title and a favicon,

107
00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:58.463
and I also already included the Lato font,

108
00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:00.194
so the Google web font.

109
00:05:00.194 --> 00:05:01.929
Because I'm assuming here

110
00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:03.539
that you are already familiar with this stuff,

111
00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.830
and so it would be pretty boring for you to watch me

112
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.388
type out this code.

113
00:05:07.388 --> 00:05:11.600
So that's the starter HTML, then we have our images again,

114
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.221
and the CSS is actually empty.

115
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:16.001
All we have is this comment here

116
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.300
where I put the three green colors

117
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.359
that we used for the branding of the webpage, okay?

118
00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:25.372
So these are the three greens that we're gonna use.

119
00:05:25.372 --> 00:05:27.186
So I think that's it for this video.

120
00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:30.141
So we saw the project. We saw the starter files.

121
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:32.813
We have everything opened up in our code editor,

122
00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:34.926
and so we're ready to go.

123
00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:39.093
So let's start coding in a second in the next video.
